//! Canonical fixed-record encoding for the typed [`EffectVmDescriptor2`] algebra.
//!
//! Descriptor JSON is a convenient Lean-to-Rust build artifact, not a protocol
//! identity.  This module starts *after* JSON parsing and encodes the closed
//! typed algebra directly.  The record has a versioned magic header, fixed
//! field order, explicit one-byte enum tags, little-endian fixed-width integers,
//! and `u64`-length-prefixed UTF-8 strings and vectors.  It has no maps, floats,
//! serde data model, postcard layout, platform-width integers, or ignored
//! fields.  Match arms and struct destructuring are deliberately exhaustive so
//! adding a descriptor constructor or field makes this module fail to compile
//! until a new schema version is designed.
