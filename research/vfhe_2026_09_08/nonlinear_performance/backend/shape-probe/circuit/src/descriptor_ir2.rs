//! Descriptor IR v2 — the EPOCH multi-table interpreter (`.docs-history-noclaude/EPOCH-DESIGN.md`).
//!
//! `lean_descriptor_air.rs` PART 6 interprets the SINGLE-table v1 EffectVM descriptor
//! (`emitVmJson`): per-row hash sites cost a 352-column Poseidon2 aux block each, and range
//! teeth cost one boolean column per bit. This module interprets the VERSIONED v2 wire
//! (`Dregg2.Circuit.DescriptorIR2.emitVmJson2`, `"ir":2`), whose grammar makes hashing a
//! BOUNDARY phenomenon: the descriptor declares TABLES and RELATIONS, and the Rust side
//! assembles a MULTI-TABLE batch STARK (`p3-batch-stark` + the `p3-lookup` LogUp argument)
//! whose instances are
//!
//!   * **main** — one trace row per effect row; interprets the embedded v1 constraint forms
//!     (`gate`/`transition`/`boundary`/`pi_binding`) on the same domains the v1 AIR used, and
//!     realizes every declared `lookup`/`mem_op`/`map_op` as a bus interaction;
//!   * **poseidon2 chip** — one row per permutation `(arity, inputs padded to rate 8, output)`,
//!     each row pinned to the REAL Poseidon2 round constraints (`poseidon2_permute_expr`) so
//!     the table is sound in exactly the sense of Lean's `ChipTableSound`; hash-site lookups
//!     ride the `ir2_p2` bus (the measured 85% lever — one aux block per UNIQUE permutation,
//!     not per row × site);
//!   * **range** — the shared `[0, 2^LIMB_BITS)` byte table (⚠ `LIMB_BITS` is **4**, so it is a
//!     `[0,16)` NIBBLE table, and see the constant for why that is a SOUNDNESS pin and not a
//!     performance one); a declared `lookup` into the range table
//!     (`rangeLimb bits`) is realized by byte-limb decomposition + LogUp byte queries + a
//!     tight top-limb bit bound (the proven `lean_lookup_air` shape; the realized relation is
//!     exactly `v ∈ [0, 2^bits)` = Lean's `range_row_mem_iff`);
//!   * **memory** — one row per state access, in log order: the offline-memory-checking
//!     instrumentation. The main AIR SENDS each guarded `(addr, value, prev_value,
//!     prev_serial, kind)` op on a permutation-check bus and the memory table RECEIVES it
//!     (exact multiset equality = Lean's `memTableFaithful`); the table's own AIR enforces the
//!     Blum discipline (positional serials, `prev_serial < serial` by range, read ⇒
//!     `value = prev_value`) and runs the read/write multiset argument
//!     (`init + writes = reads + final`, Lean `MemCheck`) on a second permutation bus against
//!     a boundary instance (declared addresses, strictly increasing ⇒ `Nodup`; address
//!     closure by lookup). Soundness of balance ⇒ consistency is the PROVED
//!     `Dregg2.Crypto.MemoryChecking.memcheck_sound`;
//!   * **map-ops** — one row per boundary reconciliation `(root, key, value, op) → new_root`,
//!     each row verifying a REAL sorted-Poseidon2-Merkle opening (leaf `hash[key, value]`,
//!     nodes `hash_fact(l, [r])`, depth 16 — byte-identical to
//!     `heap_root::CanonicalHeapTree`): `read` authenticates the leaf under `root` and pins
//!     `new_root = root`; `write` is the in-place sorted-tree leaf UPDATE (old leaf under
//!     `root`, new leaf over the SAME siblings to `new_root` — `HeapUpdateWitness`'s shape).
//!     Every permutation of the opening RIDES THE CHIP BUS (the leaf hashes as arity-2
//!     `ir2_p2` lookups, the node hashes as `ir2_fact` lookups into fact-marked chip rows) —
//!     the map row carries only the opening's spine (key/value/sibs/dirs + the 32 chain
//!     digests), never an in-row aux block. Main sends each guarded op; the table receives
//!     it (`mapTableFaithful`).
//!
//! **Descriptor-empty tables are NOT committed.** The batch is assembled over only the
//! tables the descriptor actually uses (a function of the constraint list alone, so prover
//! and verifier agree): the chip table iff any chip lookup or map op, the byte table iff any
//! range lookup or mem op, memory+boundary iff any mem op, map-ops iff any map op. FRI
//! opening cost is per-query × the row width of every committed matrix, so committing a
//! padded empty table is pure regression (`.docs-history-noclaude/PROOF-ECONOMICS.md` §2b measured the empty
//! map-ops table alone at ~1.7 MiB per transfer proof).
//!
//! **The law: Rust authors NO constraints.** Every enforced relation here is the realization
//! of a DECLARED descriptor element (a v1 form, a lookup into a declared table, a mem op, a
//! map op); the per-table AIRs discharge the per-table faithfulness obligations Lean names
//! (`ChipTableSound`, the faithful range table, `memTableFaithful`+`MemCheck`+`Disciplined`,
//! `mapTableFaithful`+`opensTo`/`writesTo`). Which wires are constrained is entirely the
//! descriptor's (= Lean's) choice.
//!
//! Two ADDITIVE table families ride the same batch, recursion-gated like everything here,
//! committed only when a descriptor uses them (`.docs-history-noclaude/UNIVERSAL-MEMORY.md` /
//! `.docs-history-noclaude/UNIVERSAL-MAP-ROTATION.md` §2.2):
//!
//!   * **map-absent** — one row per `map_op` kind `absent`: the bracketed sorted-gap
//!     NON-MEMBERSHIP opening (Lean `opensTo … none` via `opensTo_none_of_gap`): two
//!     membership paths at ADJACENT leaf positions under the same root, with
//!     `lo_addr < key < hi_addr` enforced by canonical-BabyBear-decomposition lexicographic
//!     comparators (`key = hi4·2^27 + lo27`, unique by the `is15·lo27 = 0` tooth since
//!     `p − 1 = 15·2^27` — full-felt hash-image keys order soundly). This is the
//!     once-per-touched-address boundary leg of `nullifier_fresh_binds_root`.
//!   * **umemory + umem-boundary** — the UNIVERSAL memory: `umem_op` constraints address the
//!     `Domain × κ` space as a literal `(domain, key)` pair with `Option`-valued cells
//!     `(present, value)`; ONE Blum multiset covers every domain
//!     (`UniversalMemory.universal_memory_sound`), with ZERO intra-proof hashing — a
//!     umem-only descriptor commits NO chip table (measured: a write+read-back is 67.6 KiB
//!     against 128.7 KiB for the same write as a boundary map op). Nullifier freshness is
//!     ONE read row with `present = 0` (`nullifier_fresh_sound` — no Merkle path, no gap
//!     opening); the nullifier domain's INSERT-ONLY discipline is an in-table tooth. The
//!     boundary table's declared `(domain, key)` list is Nodup by domain-major
//!     lexicographic strict increase over the canonical decomposition.
//!
//! ## Honest boundary notes (named, with their closure lanes)
//!
//!   * `map_op` kind `write` is realized as the in-place leaf UPDATE at an existing key
//!     (exactly `Heap.set` when the key is present — the cap-crown phase-B shape). A
//!     fresh-key sorted INSERT shifts leaf positions; its bracketed-insert witness can now
//!     reuse the map-absent adjacency/gap machinery and rides the nullifier-insert lane.
//!   * The universal-memory tables are the INTERIOR argument only: map roots remain derived
//!     boundary views reconciled by map ops at the proof's edge (today's map-ops machinery,
//!     once per touched key per proof — `boundary_root_from_memcheck` is the Lean anchor
//!     that both regimes commit to the same object). The full table-collapse (per-map tables
//!     subsumed for ALL live descriptors) is flag-day work by the spec's §3 ordering: it
//!     rides THE ONE ROTATION with the 3-verb executor, never before it.
//!   * The universal boundary image (`uinit`/`ufin`/declared `(domain, key)` list) is
//!     witness-supplied (`UMemBoundaryWitness`), exactly like the flat memory boundary. The
//!     INIT image is BOUND to committed PRE-state per-cell by a `MapOp::Read` opening each
//!     declared init cell against a committed-root PUBLIC INPUT (the PI-v3 ride-along; Lean
//!     anchor `UniversalMemory.boundary_init_root_derived` + the injectivity tooth
//!     `boundary_init_root_bound`, lifted to the IR as `DescriptorIR2.satisfied2U_init_root`).
//!     This is exactly `boundary_root_derived`'s `hsem` realized per address: the opened cell
//!     genuinely lives in the committed map whose root is published — a forged peer root has no
//!     membership path, a forged value opens to the genuine leaf. It is the WITNESSED
//!     CROSS-CELL-READ primitive (the circuit twin of the executor-only
//!     `StateConstraint::ObservedFieldEquals`); see `tests/effect_vm_umem_real_turn.rs`. The
//!     whole-IMAGE equality (the no-extra-cells direction) is ASSEMBLED IN LEAN at the ARITY-2
//!     MODEL peer-root leg — `UniversalBridge.crossCellRead_whole_image`
//!     (+ `_sem` / `cross_cell_read_no_extra_cell` / `_teeth`), the binary-`mapRoot_injective`
//!     companion of the per-cell `crossCellRead_refines_observedField` (⚠ this said "against the
//!     DEPLOYED binary-Merkle peer-root leg"; the deployed peer-root leg is the eight-felt arity-3
//!     `WholeImageFoldRealization.padImtRoot8` — see the correction below), exactly as the flat-sponge
//!     `UniversalMemory.boundary_whole_image_sem` (lifted to the IR as
//!     `DescriptorIR2.satisfied2U_init_whole_image`) carries it over `Heap.root_injective`: pin the
//!     published peer root to the binary fold of the ENTIRE declared whole-boundary view and, under
//!     the CR floor, the committed peer heap agrees with the declared image at EVERY address
//!     INCLUDING absence off the declared list (no extra cells — a hidden cell cannot survive the
//!     pin).
//!     ⚠ **THIS PARAGRAPH CLAIMED THAT `hpin` "(`mapRoot hash d boundaryHeap`, the sorted-leaf fold
//!     to the `2^d`-leaf root)" IS "now REALIZED in `crate::whole_image_fold`", AND THAT WAS FALSE
//!     FROM THE DAY IT WAS WRITTEN** (corrected 2026-07-28). `mapRoot` is the ARITY-2, single-felt,
//!     DENSE model fold; the chip folds `CanonicalHeapTree8::root8` — arity-3 IMT leaves
//!     `hash[addr, value, next_addr]`, EIGHT lanes, MIN sentinel, zero padding — against an
//!     eight-lane published-root PI group. `MapReconcileImtRepoint.imtRoot_ne_mapRoot` proves those
//!     are different commitments, so the chip could not realize that `hpin`, and
//!     `mapRoot_injective` was never the tooth biting in-circuit here.
//!     ★ What the chip DOES realize is
//!     `Dregg2.Circuit.WholeImageFoldRealization.wholeBoundaryFold8` (over `padImtRoot8`), whose
//!     no-extra-cells cone is `crossCellRead_wholeImage8` /
//!     `cross_cell_read_no_extra_cell8_chip` / `whole_boundary_fold8_teeth` — proved at the deployed
//!     shape, with no hash floor and two named residuals. The separation is
//!     `padImtRoot8_ne_arity2Root8`; the correspondence is pinned by
//!     `circuit/tests/whole_image_fold_lean_correspondent.rs`, and the chip's own behaviour by
//!     `tests/effect_vm_umem_real_turn.rs::cross_cell_read_whole_image_*`. The `satisfied2U_init_*`
//!     family named above is at the FLAT sponge `Heap.root` and is a THIRD object again — see the
//!     flat-boundary note below.
//!     ⚠ **THE CROSS-TABLE WIRING WAS NEVER VERIFIER-VISIBLE, AND IS DELETED** (measured
//!     2026-08-06). This paragraph used to say the binding of the chip's insert-chain
//!     `(key, value)` rows to THIS universal boundary table's per-domain `(domain, key)` cells was
//!     REALIZED by `whole_image_fold::whole_image_fold_bound_*`, with the `BUS_UMEM_ADDRS`
//!     address-closure and `BUS_UMEM_CHECK` Blum balance forcing "the chip folds EXACTLY the
//!     declared boundary". The boundary table is PROVER-SUPPLIED and carries no public values:
//!     [`verify_vm_descriptor2`] builds `pvs = [public_inputs]` then `resize(airs.len(), vec![])`,
//!     so every non-MAIN instance — including this one — is verified against an EMPTY public-value
//!     vector. The bound wrappers' public inputs were byte-identical to the unbound chip's
//!     (`[empty_root8, published_root8]`), and their three boundary teeth all refused inside
//!     `prove_whole_image_fold_bound*` — an honest prover declining a boundary inconsistent with
//!     its own fold list, which an adversary simply does not supply. The descriptors, wrappers and
//!     their eight tests are DELETED rather than re-labelled. The chip's own, genuinely
//!     verifier-visible behaviour (both root PI groups pinned + the empty-root pin) is still
//!     exercised by `tests/effect_vm_umem_real_turn.rs::cross_cell_read_whole_image_*`.
//!   * The custom table id 5 (Lean `SUBMASK_TID = 0`) is realized as the bitwise-submask
//!     relation at 30 bits (`subsetTable_mem_iff`: both elements in `[0, 2^30)` and
//!     `keep & held = keep`), enforced by per-bit decomposition — the custom-table CONTENTS
//!     manifest is the named small IR follow-up on the Lean side; until it lands the id ↦
//!     relation binding lives here, in one place.
//!   * The FLAT memory boundary image (`minit`/`mfin`/declared addresses) is witness-supplied
//!     (the `MemBoundaryWitness` instance). The flat boundary is the carrier
//!     `setFieldDynVmDescriptor2` (the post-flag-day dynamic field write) uses to hold a cell's
//!     eight user fields in FLAT MEMORY at addresses `0..7` (`EffectVmEmitV2.lean:51`) — the ONLY
//!     flat-`mem_op` carrier in the wide+umem welded registry (every other member uses anchored
//!     umem or hash-absorbed state), and STILL STAGED (the live per-slot `setfield-v1` is
//!     hash-absorption-bound, `memops=0`).
//!     SOUNDNESS ANCHOR — CLOSED (the flat twin of the umem anchor). The Lean denotation gained the
//!     flat init/fin root legs + the forge tooth, `#assert_axioms`-clean, mirroring the universal
//!     `satisfied2U_init_root` family EXACTLY (`DescriptorIR2.lean`, the §6a' block after
//!     `satisfied2_mem_consistent`):
//!       - `satisfied2_init_root` / `satisfied2_fin_root` — if the committed pre/post-state heap has
//!         the declared `minit`/`mfin` lookup semantics over the declared sorted addresses, its
//!         sorted-Poseidon2 root EQUALS the boundary fold `Heap.root (boundaryCells (some ∘ minit)
//!         maddrs)` (the universal `boundary_init_root_derived`, the flat image saturated to `some`);
//!       - `satisfied2_init_root_bound` — the forge tooth: `Heap.root_injective` under
//!         `Poseidon2SpongeCR`, so a declared image differing from the committed pre-state CANNOT
//!         keep the published root;
//!       - `satisfied2_init_whole_image` — `boundary_whole_image_sem`: pinning the committed root to
//!         the WHOLE-boundary fold forces the committed heap to BE the declared image at every
//!         address (declared cells open to `minit a`, every address off the list ABSENT) — the
//!         no-extra-cells direction that rejects a forged `minit[a]` at an untouched declared field.
//!     IN-CIRCUIT REALIZATION — ⚠ **THE OBJECT DOES NOT MATCH, AND THIS IS THE SAME CLASS AS THE
//!     umem ONE ABOVE** (measured 2026-07-28; the companion is now DELETED, see below).
//!     `satisfied2_init_whole_image` and its
//!     family are stated over the FLAT SPONGE `Heap.root hash h = hash (h.map leafOf)` — one absorb
//!     of the whole leaf list, arity-2 leaves. The `*_bound_mem` companion reused
//!     `build_whole_image_fold`, so what it actually folded and pinned was `CanonicalHeapTree8::root8` —
//!     an eight-felt arity-3 IMT MERKLE root. A Merkle root is not a flat sponge, so the companion
//!     was NOT the in-circuit realization of that Lean family; it was an unrelated commitment.
//!     ⚠ **AND THE SECOND MEASUREMENT (2026-08-06) TOOK THE REST OF IT.** This block used to add
//!     that the companion's chip-level teeth "are real" and "bite in `verify_batch`" — address
//!     closure via `BUS_MEM_ADDRS`, value equality via `BUS_MEM_CHECK` — so that "a forged `minit`
//!     folds to a different root and the published-root pin REFUSES". They did not bite in
//!     `verify_batch`. The flat `MemBoundaryWitness` is prover-supplied and its instance is verified
//!     against an EMPTY public-value vector (`pvs` reaches the MAIN instance only), so the verifier
//!     never saw the declared image at all; `whole_image_fold_bound_mem_forged_minit_refuses`
//!     refused inside `prove_whole_image_fold_bound_mem`, against a boundary the same prover had
//!     just built from the same leaf list. A forging prover supplies a `minit` AND a matching fold,
//!     and both teeth are silent. So the flat-`minit` hole is **NOT covered** by anything here: the
//!     companion, its witness builder, its prove/verify pair and its four tests are DELETED. The
//!     honest repair is unchanged and now unattended — the flat twin of
//!     `Dregg2.Circuit.WholeImageFoldRealization` plus a PI that anchors the declared image, i.e.
//!     `setFieldDynVmDescriptor2` publishing `minit_root`/`mfin_root` pinned to the turn's committed
//!     pre/post-state root (the RESIDUAL named immediately below, which is the same work).
//!     RESIDUAL — the per-EFFECT VK weld. Like the umem boundary (still "witness-supplied" at its
//!     effect descriptors, the anchor realized as the `whole_image_fold` companion), the flat fold
//!     is realized as a companion, NOT yet welded into `setFieldDynVmDescriptor2` itself. Welding it
//!     — `setFieldDynVmDescriptor2` publishes `minit_root`/`mfin_root` PIs pinned to the turn's
//!     committed pre/post-state root, with the fold (running-root columns in the memory-boundary
//!     table +
//!     the boundary producer, or an in-batch fold AIR) proving the pin, then `emit-descriptors.sh`
//!     re-emit so its VK MOVES (`check-descriptor-drift.sh`) — is what makes a forged-`minit` proof
//!     of setFieldDyn ITSELF refuse in `verify_batch` (today the companion is a separate proof).
//!     Two known weld details: (a) the field addresses `0..7` include addr 0, which the binary
//!     Merkle sorted-insert rejects as a sentinel collision (an address offset, or sentinel-handling
//!     adjustment, is needed for the fold over the real `0..7` plane — the companion test uses
//!     non-zero addresses, as the umem tests do); (b) the cross-binding `MemOp::Read` links join the
//!     effect's memory log, so the fin-side fold + `setFieldDyn_memLog` need the joined-log
//!     accounting worked through. The carrier stays STAGED until this weld lands; the soundness
//!     anchor + the biting forge tooth are in place.
//!   * v1 descriptors (no `"ir"` key) keep proving through `lean_descriptor_air::
//!     prove_vm_descriptor` untouched — both registries live until the flag-day.

/// 2. **THE RADIX HAS FOUR COPIES and they must become one**: this constant,
///    `TableAirIR.LIMB_BITS` (which every Lean table AIR's `decompCols` reads),

/// 4. **Then the VK epoch**, plus `verify_vm_descriptor2`'s `expected_byte_degree` (already
///    derived from this constant, so it follows for free).
///
/// ⚠ And the ORIGINAL justification is still wrong in the other direction, so do not restore it:

// contracts the walk did:
//
// ⚑ `Shr(i)` is a CLONE of the already-resolved `dv[i]`, never a re-walk of `defs[i]`. That is
// what makes the emitted DAG cost the prover what the deleted hand-written arm cost it: on the
// prover's folder `AB::Expr` is a packed field value, so the clone is a copy of a number, and
// the chip's 16 per-round S-box values are computed once each and read 35 times — exactly the
// sharing `poseidon2_permute_expr_lanes` had as Rust locals. Measured on the chip: 70,524
// field operations as a tree, 2,943 shared.
//
// ⚠ An out-of-range `Shr` reads ZERO. That case is unreachable — `LeanTableAir::check` refuses
// a forward reference and an out-of-range index at DECODE time, and the artifacts are
// `include_str!`d so a failure there is a build-time defect — but the evaluator stays total,
// and a `0` is the value a dropped definition would have. It is the refusal upstream that is
// load-bearing, not the fallback.
//
// And `Prep(i)` reads a DIFFERENT COLUMN SPACE — the verifier-recomputed preprocessed row,
// never the committed one; `LeanTableAir::check` bounds every index against the emission's own
// `prep_width`.

/// ⚑ **A two-row arithmetic expression WITH A CHALLENGE LEAF** (Lean `DescriptorIR2.ChalExpr`).
///
/// [`WindowExpr`] plus `Chal(i)` — the `i`-th element of
/// [`p3_air::PermutationAirBuilder::permutation_randomness`], a Fiat–Shamir value the VERIFIER
/// draws. This is the leaf whose absence `PastaFieldSound.lean` recorded as
/// *"Schwartz–Zippel … is not expressible in this IR … Adding a challenge leaf is a change to the
/// IR and the prover, not to a descriptor."* This is that change.
///
/// ## The Fiat–Shamir story, read off the deployed transcript
///
/// `p3-batch-stark/src/prover.rs` calls `transcript.observe_main(&main_commit, &pub_vals)` —
/// committing the whole main trace and the public values — and only THEN
/// `transcript.sample_perm_challenges(...)`. So every value this leaf can read was sampled after
/// the witness was fixed. That ordering is the hypothesis Schwartz–Zippel needs, and it is a
/// property of the deployed prover rather than an assumption made here.
///
/// The values are `SC::Challenge = BinomialExtensionField<BabyBear, 4>`, `|K| ≈ 2^124`, so a
/// degree-`d` residual survives a random draw with probability `≤ d / 2^124`. The gate is therefore
/// evaluated with [`p3_air::ExtensionBuilder::assert_zero_ext`], not `assert_zero`.
///
/// ## ⚑ Degree: a challenge is DEGREE ZERO
///
/// `p3-air/src/symbolic/variable.rs:67-72` gives `ExtEntry::Challenge` a `degree_multiple()` of
/// `0` — a challenge is a constant for quotient sizing. So an `L`-deep Horner chain over the
/// challenge raises the constraint degree by NOTHING, and a body that is degree 2 in the trace
/// columns stays a degree-2 constraint however much challenge arithmetic it contains. That is the
/// property that makes replacing `2L−1` schoolbook coefficient gates by ONE identity actually
/// cheaper rather than a quotient-degree trade.
///
/// ## ⚠ What a caller may and may not assume about the indices
///
/// The slice is the LogUp `(α, β)` pair of each of this instance's lookup contexts, re-read. Every
/// entry is uniform and independent of the committed trace, which is all Schwartz–Zippel asks. But
/// GLOBAL bus challenges are shared by bus name across instances, so two entries MAY BE EQUAL, and

///
/// Every mutation sweep in the table-AIR cutover runs through the row-local builder, and that
/// builder used to hand every AIR an EMPTY preprocessed window. For `Ir2Air::Main` and the ten
/// singleton `Ir2Air::LeanTable`s that is correct — none declares preprocessed columns — but it
/// made the instrument structurally blind to the exact-public arm, whose manifest VALUES and
/// PINNED multiplicities live *entirely* in the preprocessed matrix and whose one gate reads
/// nothing else. An arm that a sweep cannot reach is an arm no sweep can certify, and the moment a
/// Lean-authored table declares a preprocessed matrix (`TableAirIR` §7, item 4) the same harness
/// would have swept the new columns against nothing while reporting a clean undetected set.
///
/// ## ⚑ IT REFUSES; IT DOES NOT SUBSTITUTE
///
/// The shape contract is checked against the AIR's OWN `BaseAir::preprocessed_width` — the
/// authority on whether an arm reads preprocessed columns, so a future arm is covered without
/// editing this function — and a mismatch returns `false`:
///
/// * an AIR that declares `pw` preprocessed columns MUST be handed exactly `rows.len()` prep rows
///   of width `pw`. Handing it `&[]` is REFUSED, not silently zero-filled: zeros are a *witness*,
///   and a sweep that accepts against a witness it invented is the gate that cannot go red;
/// * an AIR that declares NONE must be handed none. A caller supplying a preprocessed matrix to
///   `Ir2Air::Main` has confused two instances, and that is a defect rather than a no-op.
///
/// `prep_next` is the wrap row, matching the main window — though every deployed prep-reading arm
/// declares `preprocessed_next_row_columns() == []` and reads only `current_slice()`.

/// **THE row-local constraint walk — the one place a descriptor's own algebra becomes an AIR.**
///
/// Both interpreters call this: [`Ir2Air::Main`] (which then adds its bus interactions) and
/// [`Ir2UniAir`] (which has no bus). It is bounded on plain [`AirBuilder`] — the WEAKEST bound p3
/// has — which is the point. `Ir2Air`'s `Air` impl is bounded on
/// `PermutationAirBuilder + InteractionBuilder` because *some* of what it does speaks on a bus;
/// carrying that bound on the row-local algebra too meant a bus-free descriptor could not be
/// interpreted under `p3_uni_stark` at all, and THAT is why `mina_stark_fixture.rs` grew a
/// hand-written Rust AIR (HORIZONLOG E4). The bound belonged on the bus part, not on this.
///
/// ## Why LIST ORDER, and why that changed
///
/// This used to be four blocks — a `when_first_row` block, a `when_last_row` block, a
/// `when_transition` block, then the every-row windowed gates — so the emission order was
/// `[all first-row, all last-row, all transition, all whole-domain]` regardless of what the
/// descriptor said. That grouping bought nothing (`FilteredAirBuilder` clones its condition per
/// assert either way; the selectors are single leaf nodes) and cost something real:
/// `VerifierConstraintFolder::assert_zero` accumulates `acc = acc * alpha + C`, so the emission
/// order IS the folding order, and a grouped traversal makes that order an artifact of THIS
/// FUNCTION rather than of the descriptor. An independent implementation of the verifier —
/// `bridge/mina-zkapp`'s o1js twin is the one that exists — has to reproduce it exactly.
///
/// Walking in list order makes the LEAN DESCRIPTOR the authority. That is the property that lets a
/// foreign verifier be written against the emitted artifact instead of against a reading of Rust.
///
/// Nothing outside pins the old order: the recursive VK's `air_fingerprint` is taken over the
/// DESCRIPTOR (`recursive_witness_bundle.rs:148`), not over the symbolic constraints; no proof
/// bytes are checked in; and `get_symbolic_constraints` has no caller in `src/`. Prover and
/// verifier both come from here, so they moved together.
///
/// ## ⚑ The challenge arm and its FAIL-CLOSED refusal (2026-08-05)
///
/// `VmConstraint2::ChalGate` reads `builder.permutation_randomness()`. Three facts make that sound:
///
/// 1. **The values are post-commitment.** `p3-batch-stark`'s prover observes the main-trace
///    commitment and the public values BEFORE it samples them, so the prover fixes its witness
///    without knowing them. That is the Schwartz–Zippel hypothesis, and it is the deployed
///    transcript's property, not an assumption.
/// 2. **The slice can be too short in exactly one pass, and that pass discards constraints.**
///    `Lookups::from_air` extracts bus interactions under `AirLayout::from_air`, which leaves
///    `num_permutation_challenges = 0`. Every pass that CONSUMES constraints — the symbolic
///    quotient-degree pass, the LogUp trace builder, the prover and verifier folders, the debug
///    checker — is handed the real count.
/// 3. **So a short slice REFUSES rather than reading a zero.** When
///    `permutation_randomness().len() < desc.challenges` this arm emits `assert_zero(ONE)`, an
///    unsatisfiable constraint. A proof produced or accepted under an inadequate challenge supply
///    cannot verify. `check_descriptor2` refuses the same descriptor one stage earlier, at decode;
///    this is the backstop, and it is closed, not open. Substituting `ExprEF::ZERO` — the pattern
///    the table evaluator (`flat_eval::FlatExpr::eval_table`) uses for an out-of-range `Shr` —
///    would have evaluated the identity AT THE ORIGIN, which a prover can satisfy for free.
///
/// ⚠ `chal_gate` is a CALLER-SUPPLIED arm rather than an inline one, because the extension-field
/// assert needs `ExtensionBuilder + PermutationAirBuilder` and `Ir2UniAir` rides `p3-uni-stark`,
/// whose folders implement neither. Splitting the WALK would have made the emission order — which
/// IS the folding order, and which a foreign verifier reproduces — an artifact of two functions.
/// So the walk stays single and the one arm that needs more capability is passed in. The uni-stark
/// caller supplies a FAIL-CLOSED arm (an unsatisfiable constraint), and `Ir2UniAir::new` has
/// already refused every descriptor that carries a `ChalGate`, so it is unreachable there rather
/// than silently skipped.

// `Ir2UniAir` — the SINGLE-TABLE, BUS-FREE descriptor interpreter (uni-stark)
// ============================================================================

/// **The IR-v2 interpreter for a descriptor that rides plain `p3_uni_stark`.**
///
/// [`Ir2Air`] is bounded on `PermutationAirBuilder + InteractionBuilder` because it serves the
/// multi-table assembly: chip lookups, the memory multiset, the exact-public manifests. The
/// uni-stark folders (`ProverConstraintFolder` / `VerifierConstraintFolder` / `SymbolicAirBuilder`)
/// implement neither — they have no permutation trace to speak on — so a descriptor that needs no
/// bus could not be proven through the uni-stark protocol at all. That gap is why
/// `circuit/src/bin/mina_stark_fixture.rs` carried a HAND-WRITTEN Rust AIR (law #1 violation,
/// HORIZONLOG E4). This closes it: the same emitted descriptors, interpreted under the weakest
/// builder bound p3 has.
///
/// ## Two properties this has that [`Ir2Air`] does not, both load-bearing
///
/// 1. **It walks `constraints` in LIST ORDER.** `Ir2Air` groups by domain (first-row block,
///    last-row block, transition block, then every-row) because for a multi-table AIR the order is
///    immaterial — the accumulator is the prover's and the verifier's alike. It is NOT immaterial
///    to a FOREIGN verifier: `VerifierConstraintFolder::assert_zero` accumulates
///    `acc = acc * alpha + C`, so an independent implementation (`bridge/mina-zkapp`'s o1js twin)
///    must fold in exactly the order the AIR emitted. Walking in list order makes the LEAN
///    DESCRIPTOR the authority on that order, instead of a Rust traversal's grouping.
/// 2. **It is fail-closed on every kind it cannot serve.** [`Ir2UniAir::new`] REFUSES a descriptor
///    that declares tables, hash sites, ranges, or any bus-bearing constraint, rather than
///    silently dropping them — a dropped lookup is an accepted forgery.
///
/// It authors no algebra: every asserted polynomial comes from `eval_expr` over the decoded
/// descriptor, and the selector comes from the builder's own `is_*_row`. The single `assert_zero`
/// below is `FilteredAirBuilder::assert_zero`'s own body (`condition * x`), inlined because the
/// filtered sub-builder cannot be opened per-constraint without re-grouping.

///
///  * **is arity `a` admitted at all?** — `chip_air_row_accepts(a, [0; CHIP_RATE])`. An
///    inadmissible `a` leaves the admission product non-zero and no witness can rescue it, so the
///    descriptor that asks for it is UNPROVABLE (`guarded-hiding-span-…-blind5-v1` asks for 8 and
///    14; the pre-`57105f387` wide blinded tooth asked for 9).
///  * **does lane `i` genuinely enter the preimage at arity `a`?** —
///    `chip_air_row_accepts(a, e_i)` for the unit input `e_i`. If the AIR pins lane `i` to zero at
///    that arity, a non-zero there is unsatisfiable and this is `false`.
///

/// multiset leg and are swallowed. That is the whole of the Chip arm's own algebra — the
/// admission product, the `big`/`wide`/`node8` selector gates, the input-lane pins, the S4/S5/S6
/// seed blend and the full Poseidon2 permutation with its output-lane equalities.

/// ```text

/// ```
///
/// and descriptor `k` owns instances `main_index(k) ..= main_index(k) + tables_k`. Use
/// [`batch_main_instance_index`] / [`batch_instance_owner`] rather than re-deriving it; a
/// refusal's `index: Some(n)` is named by the latter. **What broke:** any caller that read a
/// refusal's instance index as a descriptor index is wrong for a batch containing an
/// exact-public descriptor (it stays correct for an all-table-free batch, where every `tables_j`
/// is 0 and the sum collapses to `k`). Nothing is persisted or on the wire, so there is nothing to
/// migrate — proofs are minted per run.
///
/// ## ⚑ SECOND FLAG DAY, same date: the stride was one instance per manifest ROW
///
/// Until the single-instance exact-public realization landed, this path emitted one instance per
/// declared manifest ROW, and `MAX_EXACT_PUBLIC_ROWS` was 128 because of it. Both the COUNT and the
/// admissible manifest size change; a four-slice contents-bound cut over 128-row manifests goes
/// from 516 instances to 8. Proofs are minted per run, so nothing needs migrating, but any test
/// asserting `degree_bits.len()` against the old stride goes red — which is the intended failure.
///
/// ⚑ The exact-public LogUp bus is named by TABLE ID alone (`exact_public_bus_name`), and LogUp
/// balance in a batch STARK is GLOBAL. Two descriptors in one batch declaring the same wire id
/// therefore share one bus: their queries and manifest capacity pool, and one descriptor's extra
/// query can be cancelled by another's spare capacity. Give co-batched descriptors DISTINCT
/// exact-public wire ids if you want per-descriptor multiset equality. **The single-instance
/// realization does not change this hazard and does not introduce a new one:** the bus name is
/// still `exact_public_bus_name(table.id)`, computed from the same field, and one table id still
/// means one bus. What it does change is that a shared id now pools two whole manifests' capacity
/// in one place rather than across two runs of row instances — the same defect, not a wider one.
///
/// ## What this adds, and what it deliberately does not
///
/// It adds PLUMBING. Every constraint still comes from the Lean-emitted descriptors: this
/// function clones them into `Ir2Air::Main`, whose `eval` reads `desc.constraints`. No constraint,
/// builder gadget or `air_accepts` predicate is authored here.
///
/// ## Per-instance `degree_bits` are the trace HEIGHTS
///
/// `ProverData::from_instances` reads `instance.trace.height()` and records
/// `log2(height) + is_zk()` per instance, so the caller sets them by handing each descriptor a
/// trace of its own power-of-two height. Heterogeneous heights are the ordinary case.
///
/// ## The self-verify is NOT optional
///
/// The tail mirrors [`prove_vm_descriptor2_inner`]'s unconditional `verify_batch`, for the reason
/// recorded there: a descriptor made only of algebraic gates has NOTHING else checking it in a
/// release build, and without this `prove` would return `Ok` for an all-zeros trace. The
/// four-way-cut descriptors are exactly that shape — 78 constraints, zero lookups — so this path
/// would inherit the identical 35-day fail-open if the check were ever made conditional.
