///
/// **The Lean file is the authority; this is its twin.** `fieldToLanes9_injective` and

/// LEAN encoder — an explicit bijection onto its image with a total decoder and a left inverse, not

/// together is the Lean-COMPUTED protocol vectors and the round-trip sweep in
/// `circuit/tests/field_lanes9_injective.rs`. Read that as "case-tested against a verified spec",
/// never as "verified".
///
/// ## Why nine
///
/// `p = 2013265921`, `log₂ p = 30.907`: eight lanes carry **247.26 bits** against a 32-byte field's
/// **256**, so *no* 8-lane encoding of 32 bytes is injective under ANY chunking — pigeonhole, before
/// a line of code is read. That is why every previous repair of this octet (an eight-way Horner
/// fold, then a `u32 % p` chunking, then a Poseidon2 image over an injective preimage) moved the
/// attacker's COST and never reached injectivity; the last of them priced out at a `2^92.7`
/// collision, below the ~124-bit bar quoted elsewhere in this tree. `P^8 < 2^256 ≤ P^9`
/// (`nine_lanes_is_the_minimum`): nine is the minimum, and this is that encoding.
///
/// ## The layout
///
/// ```text
///   lane 0   = u32::from_be_bytes(b[28..32]) % p      -- the kernel u64 lane's lo32, deployed ABI
///   lane 1   = u32::from_be_bytes(b[24..28]) % p      -- the kernel u64 lane's hi32, deployed ABI
///
///   q0 = u32::from_be_bytes(b[28..32]) / p            -- in {0,1,2}, since 2p < 2^32
///   q1 = u32::from_be_bytes(b[24..28]) / p            -- in {0,1,2}
///   carry = q0 + 4·q1                                 -- ≤ 10, ONE base-256 digit

///   lane 2+i = (W / 2^(28i)) % 2^28,  i = 0..6        -- seven 28-bit digits, low first
/// ```
///
/// `W < 11·2^192 < 2^196 = (2^28)^7`, so it is EXACTLY seven base-`2^28` digits and nothing
/// reduces. `7 × 28 = 196` is the tight fit, and the `u32 % p` lane shape — the shape that aliased —
/// never appears among the free lanes.
///
/// ## Why lanes 0 and 1 could not move
///
/// Together they are the kernel's u64 lane (`field_from_u64`'s payload window, bytes `24..32`):
/// lane 0 is welded to the v1 face column `stateBase + FIELD_BASE + i`, forced by `gFieldWriteP1`
/// against `param1`, and read by `field_to_u64`; lane 1 is the staged capacity descriptors' named
/// hi-pin slot. The escrow / discharge / vault welds, `setfield_encoder_window_gate` and every app
/// encoder (`deos-js-core::pack_u64`, `starbridge-web-surface::pack_coord`) depend on lane 0
/// carrying the RAW numeric value **for `v < p = 2013265921`** — not `v < 2^31`, which is what the
/// deleted `field_limbs8` doc claimed until 2026-07-30 and is false across the 134-million-wide
/// window `[p, 2^31)`. Above `p` lane 0 is the residue and the quotient rides lane 8.
/// So injectivity had to come from the seven free lanes PLUS those two — never by moving them. The
/// pinned pair is asserted against an INDEPENDENT transcription of the ABI (big-endian `u32` over
/// `b[28..32]` / `b[24..28]`, reduced) in
/// `field_lanes9_injective.rs::lanes_0_and_1_are_the_deployed_big_endian_u64_window`, not against a
/// second encoder body — the previous pin compared this function to `field_limbs8`, which meant it
/// went silent the moment that twin was deleted.
///
/// Lane 0 STILL ALIASES on its own — `x` and `x + p` share it, and that is the pinned ABI. What
/// changed is that the ALIAS NO LONGER REACHES THE VECTOR: the quotient it drops is carried in the
/// carry digit and therefore in lane 8. That pair is the alias pole of the test.

///
/// ## ⚑ Why this function exists at all — the wound it closes (2026-08-08)
///
/// This recipe used to be spelled THREE times: once in the Lean AIR, once as a
/// `const QUAD_IDX: [[usize; 4]; 4]` hand-typed inside
/// `trace_rotated::append_sovereign_key_commit_rider`, and once — by reference — in
/// `TurnExecutor::pubkey_to_witness_key_commit`, which simply called
/// `dregg_commit::typed::canonical_32_to_felts_4`. On 2026-08-01 the key-nonet flag day
/// (`6441705e8`) rewrote THAT function into a single arity-16 absorb over the nonet, on a census
/// which recorded the four-felt id fold as off-AIR — "no descriptor width, no PI count, no VK". The
/// census missed this consumer. From that commit the executor computed one function and the AIR
/// forced a different one: transcript divergence, `InvalidPowWitness`, and
/// `rotated_sovereign_make_sovereign_proves_and_verifies` red while its nine record-pin siblings
/// passed.
///
/// The single-file repair — point the executor back at the octet recipe — was FORBIDDEN, because
/// the octet cover was itself the second half of the wound: `KEY_COMMIT_QUAD_IDX` read only lanes
/// 0..7, and lane 8 is the ONLY committed column carrying source bit 255, which RFC 8032 makes an
/// Ed25519 key's x-sign. A key and its negation — a keypair whose private half is `-a mod L`, which
/// an attacker HOLDS — therefore published bit-identical teeth. Row 2 now reads `[8, 0, 4, 2]`
/// instead of `[0, 4, 2, 6]`: full nine-lane cover, unchanged arity, unchanged
/// `KEY_COMMIT_SPAN = 32`, unchanged trace width.
///
/// ## Substrate, stated plainly
///
/// [`KEY_COMMIT_QUAD_IDX`](super::layout_generated::KEY_COMMIT_QUAD_IDX) is GENERATED by
/// `EmitLayoutManifest.lean` from `CarrierOctetGates.quadIdx`, so the matrix has ONE source and
/// this body is its reader. The FOLD (four arity-4 absorbs, project lane 0) is written once here
