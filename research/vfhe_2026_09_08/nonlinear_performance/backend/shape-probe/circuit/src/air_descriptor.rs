//! AIR shape descriptors and fingerprints (VK v2 lane).
//!
//! Per `VK-AS-RE-EXECUTION-RECIPE.md` §v2, a `vk_hash` for a cell program
//! commits to four components — program bytes, AIR shape, verifier impl,
//! proving system. This module is the home of the **AIR shape** layer.
//!
//! An [`AirDescriptor`] is a static description of a hand-written AIR's
//! externally visible shape: how many trace columns it uses, what its
//! public-input layout looks like, how many algebraic constraints it
//! carries, and what maximum polynomial degree they reach. The
//! [`fingerprint`] function compresses this description into a 32-byte
//! hash under the domain `"dregg-air-fingerprint-v1"` — the value that
//! goes into [`crate::vk_v2::VkComponents::air_fingerprint`] when
//! computing a cell-program VK that should bind to a *specific* AIR.
//!
//! ## Why this matters
//!
//! Pre-v2, `canonical_program_vk(program)` returned `BLAKE3(domain ||
//! postcard(program))` — committing only to the program spec. If two
//! cells ran the same `CellProgram` against different AIRs (say, the
//! Effect VM AIR vs. a note-spending AIR with a different column layout
//! and PI shape), they would share a vk_hash. A validator could not
//! tell them apart from the VK alone, which is the wrong story:
//! re-execution against the wrong AIR is a soundness failure.
//!
//! v2 fixes this by mixing the AIR fingerprint into the vk_hash. Each
//! hand-written AIR module exports `pub const AIR_DESCRIPTOR:
//! AirDescriptor` that captures its shape; callers (cell-program VK
//! computation, custom-effect registration, custom-predicate
//! registration) pass the descriptor's fingerprint as one of the four
//! components.
//!
//! ## Adding a new AIR
//!
//! When you add a hand-written AIR, add a `pub const AIR_DESCRIPTOR:
//! AirDescriptor` at the bottom of the AIR's module. The descriptor
//! should be `const`-evaluable so the fingerprint can be computed at
//! callsite time without runtime overhead.
//!
//! The `source_hash` field is optional. If you compute the git-blob
//! hash of the AIR's source file and pin it here, you get an even
//! tighter binding: a validator can confirm the AIR source they hold
//! matches what the VK author committed to. Leave it `None` for
//! hand-written AIRs that the platform reserves and ships in-tree (the
//! source is the canonical bytes; the binding is implicit). Set it for
//! app-provided AIRs where source distribution matters.
