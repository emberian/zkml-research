//! Presentation proof: the complete zero-knowledge authorization proof.

//! Combines:
//! 1. A chain of fold steps (attenuations)
//! 2. A final authorization derivation
//! 3. Issuer membership (Merkle inclusion against federation root)
//!
//! Public inputs:
//! - Federation root (the root of trust)
//! - Request predicate (what is being authorized)
//! - Timestamp (freshness)
//!
//! Private witness:
//! - Entire token chain (sequence of fold deltas)
//! - Derivation trace (proof that the final state authorizes the request)

// DELETED 2026-08-06 (zero-constraint AIR purge): `impl Air for PresentationAir` —
// `trace_width` / `num_public_inputs` / `constraints` / `generate_trace`.
//
// EVERY constraint it produced was IDENTICALLY ZERO. Each was
// `|row, _, pi| row[i] - pi[i]`, and its own `generate_trace` returned
// `public_inputs = row.clone()`, so the checker only ever evaluated `0 - 0`. Nineteen
// named constraints (`summary_col_0_match` ..) that could not fail under any witness,
// honest or forged.
//
// It was also UNREACHABLE, which is why nothing caught it: the `Air` trait is consumed
// only by `ConstraintValidator::{verify, verify_and_report}` and
// `TraceSummary::{generate, generate_unchecked, from_trace}`, and NO call site anywhere
// in the workspace — production or test — ever passed a `PresentationAir` to one.
// `PresentationAir::prove` and `::verify_all` (the methods `bridge::present` really
// calls) dispatch to the SUB-AIRs (`FoldAir`, `DerivationAir`, `MerkleAir`) and never
// touch this impl. So the zero constraints were dead weight, not a live hole.
//
// ⚑ The real constraints for this family already exist, are AUTHORED IN LEAN, and are
// LIVE. `metatheory/Dregg2/Circuit/Emit/PresentationEmit.lean`'s
// `presentationFreshnessDesc` emits `dregg-presentation-freshness::summary-v1`, served
// by `descriptor_by_name` and verified in production by `wire::server::StarkVerifier`
// (the DEFAULT `SiloConfig` verifier). It carries the SAME 19-column summary as twenty
// `PiBinding{First, col i, pi i}` constraints — but its public inputs arrive from the
// WIRE rather than from `row.clone()`, so they CAN and DO fail: see
// `presentation_descriptor_witness::tests::forged_summary_pi_refuses` and
// `presentation_zero_constraint_purge.rs`. The witness builder is
// `crate::presentation_descriptor_witness`.

// RETIRED 2026-07-16 (mock-proof purge): the free `prove_authorization` +
// `AuthorizationProof` (a trace-digest proof over `MultiStepDerivationAir`)
