//! Committed-threshold predicate AIR.
//!
//! Proves: "I know a value that satisfies a committed threshold AND the commitment
//! matches" without revealing either the value or the threshold to third-party verifiers.
//!
//! # Protocol
//!
//! 1. Verifier commits to their threshold: `commitment = Poseidon2(threshold, blinding)`
//! 2. Verifier sends `commitment` + `threshold` + `blinding` to the prover (secure channel).
//! 3. Prover generates this proof demonstrating:
//!    - `value >= threshold` (bit decomposition with high bit = 0)
//!    - `Poseidon2(threshold, blinding) == commitment` (commitment binding)
//!    - The value is bound to a specific token state via `fact_commitment`
//! 4. Public inputs: `[threshold_commitment, fact_commitment]`
//!    - Neither the threshold NOR the value is revealed to third parties.
//!
//! # Privacy Properties
//!
//! - **Third-party verifiers** see only two commitments. They learn: "some committed
//!   value satisfies some committed threshold" (1 bit: the proof verifies or it doesn't).
//! - **Prover** learns the threshold (necessary to generate the proof).
//! - **Verifier** learns only pass/fail (from whether the prover can produce a valid proof).
//!
//! # Trace Layout
//!
//! | Column     | Description                                              |
//! |------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
//! | 0          | private_value (the attribute being proven about)         |
//! | 1          | threshold (verifier's secret threshold, in witness)      |
//! | 2          | blinding (verifier's blinding randomness, in witness)    |
//! | 3          | diff = private_value - threshold                         |
//! | 4..34      | diff_bits[0..30] (bit decomposition of diff)             |
//! | 35         | threshold_commitment (matches public input)              |
//! | 36         | fact_commitment (binding to the token state)             |
//! | 37         | poseidon2_result (computed Poseidon2(threshold, blinding)) |
//!
//! # Public Inputs
//!
//! `[threshold_commitment, fact_commitment]`
//!
//! - `threshold_commitment`: Poseidon2(threshold, blinding) — committed by the verifier.
//! - `fact_commitment`: Poseidon2(fact_hash, state_root) — binds the proven value to state.
