//! BLOCK / BATCH-level cross-cell value-conservation COLLECTOR (Σδ=0 per asset).
//!
//! ## The gap this closes (the DEEPER half of foolable gap #6)
//!
//! The committed [`crate::cross_cell_conservation_air`] proves the per-asset `Σδ=0` AIR over a LIST
//! of signed deltas — but it certifies ONE asset's list given to it. The DEPLOYED proving path
//! produces PER-CELL-ISOLATED proofs: a transfer's debit (cell A, `−10`) and credit (cell B, `+10`)
//! are SEPARATE per-cell rotated proofs, each individually valid, each publishing only its OWN
//! signed `NET_DELTA` PI (`crate::effect_vm::pi::{NET_DELTA_MAG, NET_DELTA_SIGN}`). NOTHING in the
//! deployed path collects ≥2 cells' deltas together. So a light client verifying a BLOCK of
//! individually-valid per-cell proofs cannot conclude `Σδ = 0` across the block: a prover could
//! publish cell A `−10` and cell B `+999` (no declared mint), both per-cell-valid, and mint `+989`
//! out of nothing.
//!
//! This module is the COLLECTOR that closes that: given a BLOCK = the set of verified per-cell
//! proofs (each carrying its published `(NET_DELTA, asset)`), it (a) extracts each proof's signed
//! delta via
//! [`crate::cross_cell_conservation_air::CrossCellDelta::from_net_delta_pi`], (b) groups by asset
//! (AssetId := issuer-cell), (c) runs the PROVEN per-asset AIR
//! ([`crate::cross_cell_conservation_air::verify_cross_cell_conservation`]) on each group, and
//! (d) ACCEPTS the block iff EVERY asset balances to zero, else
//! REJECTS — with NO trust beyond the per-cell proofs (which are individually valid). This is the
//! cross-cell light-client bite the per-cell path structurally cannot give.
//!
//! ## The per-asset partition is the soundness floor — AND THE CLASS IS ONLY ~31 BITS
//!
//! Each asset's `Σδ=0` is checked INDEPENDENTLY (one proven AIR run per asset class). Cross-asset
//! borrowing — "pay one asset's deficit with another asset's surplus" — cannot cross a CLASS
//! boundary: asset 7's deltas can never enter asset 8's balance (the per-asset proof's `pi[asset]`
//! partition pin, the committed AIR's `assetPinFirst/Last`). A block that nets to zero ACROSS
//! classes but is unbalanced WITHIN a class is correctly REJECTED.
//!
//! ⚠ **But a class is not an asset.** [`fold_token_id_to_asset`] maps 32-byte asset ids onto ONE
//! `BabyBear`, so the partition has ~2^30.87 classes and two distinct assets landing in one class
//! is a **2^15.67 birthday grind** — at which point the borrowing above is between two genuine
//! currencies and is INVISIBLE, here and in the verified Lean decider downstream (which is handed
//! the already-folded class). Read that function's docs before treating this partition as a floor;
//! [`assert_asset_classes_injective`] is the refusal every caller still holding the ids must run.
//!
//! ## Mint / burn are NOT a hole — and the DISCLOSURE IS A LEDGER ROW, not a claim
//!
//! This module used to carry a `DeclaredSupplyChange` row type so a block could ASSERT "this `+989`
//! is a disclosed mint" and have the assertion enter the conserved sum. **It was deleted on
//! 2026-07-28 and nothing was lost**, because the deployed supply model
//! (`.docs-history-noclaude/SUPPLY-MODEL.md`) does not disclose supply with a claim — it discloses
//! it with a *paired ledger delta*:
//!
//! * **Mint** debits the asset's ISSUER WELL (a real, signed, negative-capable `−supply` account)
//!   and credits the holder — `turn/src/executor/apply.rs::apply_mint`. Per-asset `Σδ = 0`.
//! * **Burn** is the dual: holder → well. `apply_burn`. Per-asset `Σδ = 0`.
//! * `CreateCell` **cannot** open a balance (`apply.rs`, hard `Err(CreateCellNonZeroBalance)`), so
//!   there is no implicit value entry either.
//!
//! So a genuine supply change already appears in this collector as TWO ordinary contributions that
//! cancel, and the well's leg is *auditable state* rather than an unbacked assertion. A HIDDEN mint
//! is a `+999` credit whose well leg is absent — and that is exactly what the per-asset boundary
//! catches, with no row type required.
//!
//! ⚠ Why the row type is not merely unused but WRONG here: it added `+magnitude` to the conserved
//! sum with **no authority check of any kind**, while `Effect::Mint` requires a control-grade
//! capability over the issuer well carrying the `EFFECT_MINT` facet (the Rust image of Lean
//! `mintAuthorizedB` — "a cell cannot coin its own supply"). Any caller that populated it would
//! have minted past that gate. It had no producer anywhere in the tree; every call site in the
//! executor, the bundle path and the tests passed an empty slice.
//!
//! The Lean decision procedure `Dregg2.Circuit.CrossCellConserveDecision` still MODELS declared
//! supply rows — its wire section is optional and its `#guard` for them is a true theorem about the
//! rule. That is the spec being more general than the deployment, which is fine. What is not fine
//! is a Rust parameter advertising a channel with no producer, because a parameter is a call-site
//! obligation and the next reader fills it in.
//!
//! ## ADDITIVE — the live-wire seam (NOT wired here)
//!
//! ⚠ THE SECOND, LARGER GAP THE SUPPLY-ROW DELETION MAKES VISIBLE: this collector sums the
//! contributions it is HANDED, and on both live paths the row set is built from a narrow channel —
//! `Action::balance_change` on the cleartext path (`executor/execute_tree.rs`), and
//! `Transfer`/`Burn`/`Mint` only on the mixed-atomic path (`executor/atomic.rs`). A `Σδ = 0` verdict
//! is therefore a statement about THOSE rows, not about every way value moves in a turn. See
//! `docs/reference/EXECUTED-PATH-SYMMETRY-2026-07-26.md` §2 for the four pairwise holes.
//!
//! This collector is BUILT + TESTED here over REAL multi-cell proofs, ADDITIVE. It is NOT invoked by
//! the deployed verifier. The live-wire is the serialized handoff. The DEPLOYED path ALREADY
//! collects the proven per-cell deltas — it just sums them OFF-AIR, single-asset:
//!
//! > **`turn/src/executor/atomic.rs::Executor::execute_atomic_sovereign`** is the exact seam. After
//! > verifying each per-cell proof, it reads that proof's PROVEN signed delta
//! > (`dregg_circuit::extract_net_delta(&public_inputs)`, the `(NET_DELTA_MAG, NET_DELTA_SIGN)` PI
//! > pair) into `proven_deltas`, then enforces `proven_deltas.iter().sum::<i64>() == 0` else
//! > `AtomicTurnError::ConservationViolation`. That scalar sum is the OFF-AIR, NOT-per-asset,
//! > NOT-in-circuit version of THIS collector. The live-wire replaces it: pair each `public_inputs`
//! > with its cell's asset class (AssetId := issuer-cell, from `entry.cell_id`), feed
//! > [`PerCellContribution::from_proof_pi`] into a [`BlockConservation`] (a mint/burn already
//! > contributes BOTH its legs, holder and issuer well), and require
//! > [`BlockConservation::prove_and_verify`] (or, on the light-client
//! > side, [`BlockConservation::verify_with_proofs`] over the published per-asset proofs). The
//! > block-rejection path is the existing `Err(AtomicTurnError::ConservationViolation)` (now carrying
//! > the per-asset imbalance) — "On failure … no state changes" (the function's atomic-commit
//! > contract is unchanged).
//! >
//! > In `node/src/turn_proving.rs` the `FullTurnWitness.conservation: None` slot becomes the
//! > per-asset proof set the collector certifies.
//!
//! ⚠ **CORRECTED 2026-08-06 — BOTH seams this paragraph names are UNREACHABLE.** The text above
//! describes `execute_atomic_sovereign` as "the exact seam" and offers a second one at
//! `verify_proof_carrying_turn_bundle`. Measured: `execute_atomic` / `execute_atomic_sovereign` have
//! no caller outside `turn/src/executor/atomic.rs` and their only in-module callers are
//! `#[cfg(test)]`; `verify_proof_carrying_turn_bundle{,_with_ledger}` had zero reachable callers and
//! were DELETED. So the "DEPLOYED path" whose off-AIR scalar sum this collector was to replace is
//! not the deployed path. The conservation gate that DOES run is
//! `turn/src/executor/execute.rs`'s `check_per_asset_conservation_by_asset_id` →
//! `check_per_asset_conservation_by_asset`, which is already per-asset and already routes the
//! decision through the installed Lean `ConservationOracle` — so the "OFF-AIR, NOT-per-asset" gap
//! this module was written against no longer describes the live executor. **The real remaining
//! handoff is a BLOCK-level (multi-turn) one, and it has no seam in the tree yet.**
//!
//! The Lean twin is `metatheory/Dregg2/Circuit/CrossCellConservation.lean` (the per-asset AIR + its
//! rejection teeth); the block-level aggregation is the proven per-asset AIR run once per asset.
