//! # `table_air` — the decoder for a Lean-authored TABLE AIR.
//!
//! ## What was missing
//!
//! IR-v2 emits the MAIN instance: an [`crate::descriptor_ir2::EffectVmDescriptor2`] carries one
//! effect's own row algebra and `Ir2Air::Main` interprets it. The other instances the deployed
//! prover assembles — the Poseidon2 chip, the byte table, the memory pair, the map-ops pair, the
//! universal-memory pair — are a SECOND kind of AIR: a shared auxiliary table with its own width,
//! its own column space, and its own bus interactions. IR-v2 had no vocabulary for that object, so
//! all of them were hand-authored Rust algebra, in direct violation of architectural law #1
//! (*"circuits are emitted from Lean; Rust only INTERPRETS"*).
//!
//! This module is the interpreter for the vocabulary. The Lean author is
//! `Dregg2/Circuit/TableAirIR.lean`; the per-table emitters are `Dregg2/Circuit/Emit/*TableEmit.lean`
//! and their emissions are `circuit/descriptors/table-airs/*.json`. **Nothing in this file authors a
//! constraint**: it decodes a wire object whose `gates` are [`TableExpr`] trees under a [`RowSel`],
//! and whose `interactions` name a bus, a call shape, a multiplicity expression and a tuple.
//! `Ir2Air::LeanTable` walks that and calls `assert_zero` / `lookup_key` / `table_entry` /
//! `receive` / `send` on exactly what it says.
//!
//! ## The two fields a descriptor `Lookup`/`Gate` could not carry
//!
//! **The multiplicity expression.** `Ir2Air::Main` hardcodes multiplicity `1` on every declared
//! lookup, because a main row is unconditionally real. A shared table is PADDED — the map-absent
//! table's chip absorbs ride at multiplicity `is_real`, so a pad row must send ZERO queries or the
//! LogUp balance is wrong — so a table IR without a per-row multiplicity expression cannot express
//! the deployed AIR at all. That is why [`TableInteraction`] exists rather than reusing `Lookup`.
//!
//! **The row selector.** ⚑ This is what blocked every table but map-absent, and it is new in the
//! second pass. The map-absent table is the ONLY purely row-local one; every other shared table is
//! a SORTED or COUNTED table whose content is a relation between ADJACENT rows, asserted under a
//! p3 row filter. [`TableGate`] carries that filter and [`TableExpr::Nxt`] reads the next row.
//!
//! ⚠ Bus interactions carry NO selector, deliberately: every deployed table pushes its
//! interactions on the unfiltered builder (a filtered p3 builder is not an `InteractionBuilder`),
//! and the padding discipline rides in the multiplicity expression instead.
//!
//! ## Column space
//!
//! `TableExpr::Loc(c)` / `Nxt(c)` here read column `c` of **this table's** current / next row, not
//! the main trace's. That is the whole "sub-descriptor at a column offset" content, and it is why
//! this is a separate `Ir2Air` arm rather than a splice into the main constraint walk.

//! ## ⚑ Column space, and why this module has its OWN expression type
//!
//! A table AIR's expression is [`TableExpr`], not the main descriptor's `TableExpr`. The decision
//! and its evidence live in the Lean author (`Dregg2/Circuit/TableAirIR.lean` §1b); the Rust side
//! mirrors it for the same reason, stated in the terms that bite here: `Ir2Air::Main` has NO
//! definition list, so a `Shr` leaf reaching it has nothing to resolve against, and it has no
//! preprocessed trace, so a future `Prep` leaf would index out of an empty slice. Widening
//! `TableExpr` would put permanently-unserviceable variants into the type `Ir2Air::Main`
//! interprets and buy a fail-closed refusal on the main decode path for each. Here they are simply
//! a different type that the main path never sees.
//!
//! The five shared constructors carry IDENTICAL wire tags to `TableExpr`'s, which is why the eight
//! artifacts emitted before the sharing node existed re-emit with every gate and interaction byte
//! unchanged.
