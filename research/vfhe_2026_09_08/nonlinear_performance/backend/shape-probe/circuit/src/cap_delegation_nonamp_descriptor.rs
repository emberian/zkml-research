//! # `cap_delegation_nonamp_descriptor` — the GENUINE-NON-AMP cap-graph descriptor loader.
//!
//! The ARGUS linchpin on the DELEGATION family (`delegate`, `delegateAtten`, `attenuate`, `introduce`,
//! `revoke`, `refresh`). One Lean-verified `EffectVmDescriptor` that, on a cap-graph row, enforces BOTH:
//!
//!   * **genuine cap-root recompute** — `new_cap_root = hash[edge_leaf, old_cap_root]` with
//!     `edge_leaf = hash[holder, target, rights, op]` (the §G prepend-accumulator advance, op-tagged), so
//!     the post `cap_root` is a FORCED function of the bound cap-edge mutation, not an opaque digest
//!     parameter — and the recomputed root is absorbed into `state_commit` (tamper ⇒ UNSAT);
//!   * **per-bit non-amplification** — the submask gates force `granted_bit ≤ held_bit` on each of the
//!     8 delegation bit carriers (`dcol.grantedBit i` = col 128+i, `dcol.heldBit i` = col 120+i). An
//!     over-grant (a granted bit set where the held bit is clear) fails the submask gate. Both legs are
//!     emitted from the proved Lean module and both are witnessed behaviourally by the tests below.
//!
//! ## THE TWO LEGS INTERLOCK — the granted recon and the cap-root recompute bind ONE felt (fixed 2026-07-17)
//!
//! The per-bit submask gates constrain `granted ⊑ held`, and the granted bits reconstruct the SAME
//! `rights` felt the recompute hashes into the edge leaf. The two mask-reconstruction gates read:
//!
//! ```text
//! gate 54:  v75 − Σ_{i<8} v(120+i)·2ⁱ     (held mask recon,    prmCol 7)
//! gate 55:  v72 − Σ_{i<8} v(128+i)·2ⁱ     (granted mask recon, prmCol cp.RIGHTS)
//! ```
//!
//! Column 72 (`prmCol cp.RIGHTS`) is exactly the felt `siteCapEdgeLeaf` hashes into `cap_root`. So
//! tampering that felt to confer rights outside the held mask breaks gate 55 ⇒ UNSAT — the interlock is
//! real. `nonamp_leg_binds_the_hashed_rights_felt` exercises it: the tamper is REFUSED.
//!
//! ### The two emit defects this used to carry (both fixed 2026-07-17)
//!
//! **Defect 1 — a param-index/column conflation.** `EffectVmEmitCapReshape.dcol.GRANTED_MASK :=
//! EffectVmEmitCapRoot.cp.RIGHTS`, and `cp.RIGHTS = 4` is a **param INDEX** — its column is
//! `prmCol 4 = 72`. `gMaskRecon` consumes a raw COLUMN, so the gate read `v4` (an effect-SELECTOR
//! column, block `0..54`) and `dcol.HELD_MASK := 7` read `v7`. Nothing related those to the rights
//! param, so a prover could confer ARBITRARY rights through a perfectly-bound `cap_root`. Fixed by
//! `prmCol`-wrapping both `gMaskRecon` call sites in `capDelegNonAmpGates`.
//!
//! **Defect 2 — the state-commit's `Digest k` ordinals were never rebased on the prepend.** Site 5
//! (`digest_col` 88 = `state_commit`) read digests `0,1,2` = cols `102, 87, 98` (edge leaf, cap root,
//! inter1) where the GROUP-4 chain intends `98, 99, 100`, so `state_after[4..10]` never reached the
//! commitment and sites 3/4 were dead carriers. Fixed by
//! `attenuateHashSites.map (shiftSiteDigests capRecomputeSites.length)` at the prepend in
//! `EffectVmEmitAttenuateA.attenuateGenuineHashSites`. `state_commit_absorbs_group4_chain` asserts it.
//!
//! Both were found by the Rust differentials below, not by Lean — `capDeleg_nonAmp_in_circuit` /
//! `capDeleg_rejects_amplify` quantify over the BIT CARRIERS (cols 128+i / 120+i) and were true either
//! way; only the PROSE claimed the felt link, and `#assert_axioms` cannot see a false sentence. Neither
//! defect was ever live — nothing routes to this descriptor (see NOT WIRED below), so both were LATENT.
//!
//! ⚠ RESIDUAL — the HELD mask (col 75 = `prmCol dcol.HELD_MASK`) is a FREE PARAM: no hash-site absorbs
//! it, no PI binds it. The interlock refutes rights-felt FORGERY, but `granted ⊑ held` bounds the
//! committed rights only by a mask the PROVER CHOSE. Binding col 75 to an opened parent cap is the next
//! rung (see `EffectVmEmitCapReshape` §4D's RESIDUAL). The mint-flavour `capReshapeVmDescriptor`
//! (a SEPARATE emitted JSON, consumed by `cap_reshape_descriptor.rs`) carried the identical Defect-1
//! conflation on its own `nonAmpGates` — FIXED 2026-07-24, with a both-ways behavioural canary
//! (`cap_reshape_descriptor.rs::held_bits_bind_the_hashed_held_mask_felt`: the deployed pre-fix bytes
//! ACCEPT the forgery, the fixed bytes REFUSE it). Those two descriptors were the whole class.
//!
//! ## Provenance (anti-drift, the LAW#1 way)
//!
//! `dregg-effectvm-attenuateA-v1-genuine-nonamp.json` is the **byte-exact** output of the verified Lean
//! emit `Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.EffectVmEmitAttenuateA.attenuateVmDescriptorGenuineNonAmp` (via
//! `emitVmJson`, the `EmitAllJson` registry line). The Rust prover INTERPRETS this descriptor via
//! `parse_vm_descriptor` (it AUTHORS NO CONSTRAINT — the gates are emitted from the proved Lean module:
//! `capDeleg_nonAmp_in_circuit` / `capDeleg_rejects_amplify` are the in-circuit teeth, both polarities).
//! The test below re-parses the JSON into the prover's structure; the Lean↔JSON drift gate is
//! generate-fresh `scripts/check-descriptor-drift.sh` (`GENUINE_NONAMP_FP` is a cache-freshness pin,
//! NOT a faithfulness check). ONE descriptor object backs all six effects (the `op` tag distinguishes the mutation,
//! so the JSON is shared — selector→JSON fan-out, like the v1 cap-graph face).
//!
//! This is a STANDALONE loader (its own module + test), NOT registered in the locked
//! `effect_vm_descriptors` registry (whose count assertions would otherwise break) — exactly as
//! `cap_reshape_descriptor` is standalone.
//!
//! ## ⚠ NOT WIRED — this descriptor is dead code at HEAD (named seam, 2026-07-15)
//!
//! Nothing routes cap-graph rows to this descriptor. `GENUINE_NONAMP_NAME` / `GENUINE_NONAMP_JSON`
//! have **zero consumers** outside this module and its own test; the delegation family proves under
//! the opaque-digest `attenuateA` face instead. So the in-circuit teeth described above are real and
//! Lean-verified, but they do **not** gate any deployed proof: the good descriptor is dead while the
//! weaker one is deployed.
//!
//! Closing this needs a selector→JSON dispatcher that routes the six cap-graph effects here (or a
//! decision to delete both standalone cap loaders). The closure lane is
//! `docs/deos/CRATE-EXCELLENCE-PLAN.md` §4 MOVE 5 ("resolve the cap-descriptor orphans — do not
//! leave the good one dead and the weak one deployed").
//!
//! ⚠ HORIZONLOG's "cap-crown IR non-amp LANDED, 2026-06-15" entry still describes the two legs as
//! INTERLOCKING on one `rights` felt. That claim is false as emitted (see above) and the entry is
//! owed a correction; it is not swept here because that file is mid-flight in another lane.
