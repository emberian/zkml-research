//! The canonical, **openable** heap commitment: a SORTED Poseidon2 binary
//! Merkle map over a cell's `(collection_id, key) → value` entries.
//!
//! ## Why this module exists (REFINEMENT-DESIGN Decision 1 / THE ROTATION)
//!
//! THE HEAP is the generalization of the proven capability root
//! ([`crate::cap_root`]) with a **generic leaf**: where the cap tree stores the
//! 7-field capability leaf keyed by `slot_hash`, the heap tree stores the arity-3
//! indexed-Merkle-tree (IMT) leaf `hash[addr, value, next_addr]` keyed by
//! `addr = hash[collection_id, key]`. Same sorted discipline, same `hash_fact`
//! nodes, same depth — reuse of verified machinery, not invention.
//!
//! ⚠ The heap tree and the cap tree **differ in their sentinel occupancy**, and the
//! difference is load-bearing: the cap tree stores BOTH the MIN and MAX sentinel
//! leaves, while the heap tree stores only the MIN sentinel — MAX survives as the
//! terminal [`HeapLeaf::next_addr`] pointer, never as a stored leaf. See
//! [`HEAP_SENTINEL_LEAVES`], and [`assert_pad_free_tail`] for why the cap tree's
//! stored MAX leaf makes its trailing-pad exposure a weaker problem than the heap's.
//!
//! This module is the **single** heap-root scheme, computed byte-identically
//! wherever it runs:
//!
//!   * the executor computes the post-write root here and carries it on the
//!     wire (`FullActionA.heapWriteA`'s `newRoot` / `WireAction::HeapWrite`),
//!     pinned into the `heap_root` register;
//!   * the cell recomputes the same root over its heap entries and refuses a
//!     mismatch (the cap Phase-A discipline);
//!   * the circuit's heap-write descriptor gadget recomputes `addr` in-row
//!     (`Dregg2/Circuit/Emit/EffectVmEmitHeapRoot.lean`: `siteHeapAddr` is an
//!     arity-2 hash site over exactly `[coll, key]` — the same image [`heap_addr`]
//!     computes here), and the deployed MapOps AIR absorbs the leaf at the
//!     arity-3 IMT shape (`descriptor_ir2::map_leaf_input_cols` =
//!     `[MAP_KEY, value, MAP_NEXT]`, the same ordered preimage
//!     [`HeapLeaf::preimage`] returns here).
//!
//! ⚠ **`EffectVmEmitHeapRoot.siteHeapLeaf` is still the RETIRED arity-2 shape
//! `hash[addr, value]`** (and `Substrate/Heap.lean`'s `leafOf` with it). That Lean
//! gadget therefore does NOT describe the leaf this module commits; the divergence
//! is measured and machine-checked on the Lean side
//! (`Dregg2.Circuit.MapReconcileImtRepoint.imtRoot_ne_mapRoot`: under the CR floor
//! an arity-3 IMT root is NEVER an arity-2 `mapRoot`) and the denotation cutover is
//! `docs/DESIGN-mapop-denotation-move.md`. Do not read the emit gadget as a pin on
//! this file's leaf until that lands.
//!
//! The ADDRESS shape is pinned by the Lean model (`Dregg2/Substrate/Heap.lean`
//! `addrOf`): **arity-2, no domain tag** — the circuit hash site recomputes this
//! exact image, so adding a tag here would fork cell from circuit. The LEAF shape
//! is written in exactly one place, [`HeapLeaf::preimage`] ([`HEAP_LEAF_ARITY`]
//! felts). The differential test
//! `circuit/tests/heap_root_cell_circuit_differential.rs` pins the scheme against
//! an independently re-derived IMT tree and pins the schema itself.
//!
//! ## Phase A scope
//!
//! Phase A makes the `heap_root` VALUE this sorted-Merkle root. The per-write
//! root ADVANCE stays pinned-as-digest at the tree layer (the circuit pins the
//! executor's computed new root and recomputes the address + leaf in-row); the
//! genuine in-circuit sorted-tree update/insert gates (membership-open +
//! leaf-update + bracketed sorted-insert, mirroring the revocation circuit)
//! are the Phase-E lane.

/// opens it) and simultaneously denies it (the identical root is also the root of
