//! **`refusal`** — the shared REFUSAL DISCRIMINATOR for adversarial tests.
//!
//! # Why this module exists
//!
//! The dominant anti-pattern in this tree's adversarial suite was:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! // IGNORED: a DELIBERATELY-BROKEN exhibit. This is the anti-pattern the module exists
//! // to replace — it is shown BECAUSE it is wrong, and the `..` placeholder is not Rust.
//! // Compiling it would defeat the point; `must_refuse` below is the shape to copy.
//! match std::panic::catch_unwind(|| prove(&desc, &forged_rows, ..)) {
//!     Err(_) => {}                              // a panic — "refused"
//!     Ok(res) => assert!(res.is_err(), "tooth OPEN"),
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! **Any** panic and **any** `Err` both count as "the forgery was refused". That tooth cannot
//! distinguish *"the constraint system rejected the forgery"* from *"the process crashed"* — so a
//! stray `.unwrap()` or a producer-side `debug_assert!` in **trace assembly** keeps it green while
//! proving nothing about the constraint system.
//!
//! This is not hypothetical. At the commit that introduced this module,
//! `descriptor_ir2::tests::ir2_forged_map_opening_refuses` reported `ok` because
//! `descriptor_ir2.rs:5195`'s `debug_assert_eq!(end, root, "old path must authenticate against
//! root8")` — a **witness-assembly sanity check**, not a constraint — panicked first. The prover
//! was never asked to refuse anything. The `Err(_) => {}` arm swallowed it.
//!
//! # What a refusal actually looks like
//!
//! There are exactly **two** honest refusal mechanisms on the `prove_vm_descriptor2*` path, and
//! they are reached under different conditions:
//!
//! 1. **A typed `Err`** — the pre-flight in-trace replay (gated on `check: true`, i.e. the public
//!    [`crate::descriptor_ir2::prove_vm_descriptor2`] entry) eagerly refuses a bad witness
//!    fail-closed and returns `Err(String)`. In a release build this is also what the batch
//!    self-verify surfaces. **This is the mechanism to prefer, and [`must_refuse`] requires it.**
//!
//! 2. **The p3 batch prover's DOCUMENTED unsat panic** — the adversarial teeth that call
//!    `prove_vm_descriptor2_inner` DIRECTLY with `check: false` bypass the replay, so the forged
//!    witness reaches `p3_batch_stark::prove_batch`. That function runs two `#[cfg(debug_assertions)]`
//!    checks which **panic** rather than return:
//!
//!    * `batch-stark/src/check_constraints.rs:133` — `panic!("constraints not satisfied on row
//!      {row_index}: failed constraints = {rendered}")`
//!    * `lookup/src/debug_util.rs:82` (via `MultiSet::assert_empty`, called by `check_lookups`) —
//!      `panic!("Lookup mismatch ({label}): tuple {:?} has net multiplicity {:?} ...")`
//!
//!    Under `cargo test` (a debug build) these fire *before* the prover could return anything, so
//!    for a `check: false` site the panic genuinely **is** the refusal. [`must_refuse_or_unsat_panic`]
//!
//! ⚑ **CORRECTION (2026-07-25) — the discriminator above is WRONG, and it misrouted a real tooth.**
//! The unsat-panic mechanism is NOT about `check: false`. The real discriminator is **whether the
//! descriptor has LOOKUPS**:
//!
//!   * **With lookups** — p3's debug check runs inside `prove_batch` and PANICS
//!     (`batch-stark/src/check_constraints.rs:133`, "constraints not satisfied on row N") **before**
//!     the self-verify can return anything. So at such a site in a DEBUG build, `Err` is
//!     structurally unreachable and [`must_refuse`] cannot pass.
//!   * **Without lookups** — p3 gates that check on `if !all_lookups[i].is_empty()`
//!     (`batch-stark/src/prover.rs:232`), so it never runs at all, and only the producer's
//!     self-verify `Err` fires (surfacing as e.g. `OodEvaluationMismatch`).
//!
//! Note also that `prove_vm_descriptor2_for_config`'s `check: true` pre-flight replays only the
//! mem/map/umem/exact-public/submask witnesses — **not** the algebraic gates or the PI pins
//! (`descriptor_ir2.rs:4432-5471`). So `check: true` does not mean "an `Err` will describe a bad
//! witness".
//!
//! This is why the same helper was correct in `custom_leaf_adapter` (an arity pre-flight, a genuine
//! `Err`) and wrong in `shielded_ring_clearing_air` (a lookup-carrying descriptor, an unavoidable
//! panic). Two forgery teeth sat RED for ten days on that mistake while asserting the *right* thing —
//! the constraint system refused every forgery; the harness just could not observe it. **Pick the
//! helper by whether the descriptor has lookups, not by the `check` flag.**
//!
//! ⚑⚑ **SECOND CORRECTION (2026-07-29) — the paragraph above says `check && debug_assertions`, and
//! THAT WAS THE BUG.** The producer self-verify was gated on `cfg!(debug_assertions)` from
//! `934258ea0` (2026-06-24), so under `--release` a forged witness reached NEITHER mechanism: p3's
//! two panics are `#[cfg(debug_assertions)]` and the self-verify was too. `prove_vm_descriptor2`
//! returned `Ok` for an all-zeros trace, and **twenty** forgery teeth across `dregg-circuit` and
//! `dregg-circuit-prove` reported "the forgery was ACCEPTED" for 35 days. The self-verify runs in
//! every profile now (`descriptor_ir2::prove_vm_descriptor2_inner`, under `check` alone).
//!
//! The doctrine that follows from it: **a tooth that accepts only [`P3_UNSAT_PANIC_MARKERS`] is a
//! DEBUG-ONLY tooth**, because both of those strings come from `#[cfg(debug_assertions)]` code in
//! p3. Pair them with [`DEPLOYED_VERIFIER_REFUSAL_MARKERS`] — the verdicts that exist in every
//! profile — or, when the tooth's subject is a specific gate, use
//! [`assert_violated_constraint_not_bus`], which keeps the constraint-vs-bus discrimination
//! identically in both.
//!    accepts it — but **only** it, matched by message against [`P3_UNSAT_PANIC_MARKERS`]. Any other
//!    panic (a trace-assembly `debug_assert`, a stray `unwrap`, an index OOB, an OOM) is a **test
//!    failure**, because it is not a refusal — it is a crash wearing a refusal's clothes.
//!
//! Note what is deliberately **not** in the marker list: `check_constraints.rs:54/62`'s
//! `assert_eq!` on trace heights, and `debug_util.rs:243`'s `"only two-row windows are supported"`.
//! Those are **shape/deploy faults**, not unsat verdicts. A tooth that "passes" because the trace
//! was the wrong height has not witnessed a refusal, so those panics red the test.
//!
//! # The `Err` side of the same disease
//!
//! The paragraph above closed the discrimination on the **panic** side only. A shape fault reached
//! through an `Err` was still laundered: `Ok(Err(e)) => e` handed **any** error back as a refusal, so
//! `base row width 3065 must equal descriptor trace_width 1963` — the prover's *pre-flight arity
//! check*, fired before the constraint system reads one cell of the witness — satisfied a forgery
//! tooth exactly as a stray `unwrap` used to. That was found in the wild
//! (`circuit/tests/heap_write_roundtrip.rs`, which was green with the forgery neutered) and repaired
//! only in that one file. [`SHAPE_FAULT_MARKERS`] and [`assert_committed_shape`] are that repair,
//! lifted here so every site inherits it; [`must_refuse`], [`must_refuse_or_unsat_panic`] and
//! [`classify`] all RED on a shape-marked `Err`. A tooth whose *subject* is the arity pre-flight says
//! so by name with [`must_refuse_shape_fault`].
//!
//! # Placement
//!
//! This is test-support code living in a production crate's `src/`, which deserves a justification:
//!
//! * `dregg-circuit-prove` depends on `dregg-circuit` as a **normal** `[dependencies]` entry, so one
//!   `pub mod` here is reachable from both crates' unit tests (`#[cfg(test)]` in `src/`) **and**
//!   their integration tests (`tests/`, which link the crate as an external rlib and therefore
//!   cannot see a `#[cfg(test)]` module). No other single placement covers all four.
//! * It is deliberately **not** behind a Cargo feature. A feature that arms test-only code is
//!   exactly the `test-stubs` leak this tree already has (CRATE-EXCELLENCE-PLAN §1.3: feature
//!   unification armed `StubVerifier` inside the production node binary). Features unify; `pub mod`
//!   does not.
//! * The soundness surface is nil in the strict sense: this module has no accept path. Every
//!   function here either returns a refusal reason or panics. It can only make a test **stricter**,
//!   never more permissive, so shipping it in a production build arms nothing.
