//
// SEVEN published felts stood here, at v1 offsets 26..32, and they are GONE:
//
//   26      CURRENT_BLOCK_HEIGHT   the constant `0` — `EffectVmContext::default()`, never
//                                  overridden by any producer, never touched by
//                                  `verify_one_cohort_run`'s reconstruction. The live temporal
//                                  binding is `v3::COMMITTED_HEIGHT`, pinned 56/56 AND overridden
//                                  by the verifier from `cell.state.committed_height()`. The
//                                  comparison that would have made 26 "the verifier-supplied
//                                  comparand" was written NOWHERE.
//   27      MAX_CUSTOM_EFFECTS     the constant `MAX_CUSTOM_EFFECTS_DEFAULT` (4) on producer AND
//                                  verifier. The cap IS enforced — off-circuit, from the
//                                  verifier's own ledger (`read_cell_max_custom_effects` → the
//                                  `proofs.len() > cap` refusal), which is strictly stronger than
//                                  a felt the prover wrote.
//   28      CUSTOM_EFFECT_COUNT    the real count, but re-derived identically by every consumer.
//                                  Its four OFF-CIRCUIT readers used it as the length prefix of
//                                  the custom-proof array; they now call [`custom_entry_count`],
//                                  which derives the length from the PI VECTOR THE VERIFIER
//                                  HOLDS. That is the stronger of the two, so this is a gain.
//                                  The "Stage 1 sum-check (Group 7)" three docblocks credited
//                                  never existed: `aux_off::CUSTOM_COUNT_ACC` is filled by the
//                                  trace generator and read by NO constraint.
//   29..32  APPROVED_HANDOFFS[4]   the empty-tree zero sentinel. `ValidateHandoff` has not been
//                                  an effect since the verb-lockstep pass.
//
// Measured before the cut, from the emitted registry bytes
// (`scripts/pi_disposition_census.py`): **0 `pi_binding`s at every one of the seven, on all 57
// wide members and all 60 v3 members.** A `pi_binding` is the only constraint kind that reads a
// public input, so the constraint system never looked at any of them.
//
// ⚠ AND THE PART THAT NEARLY WENT WRONG. A prior lane priced ELEVEN — these seven plus
// `EFFECTS_HASH_GLOBAL` (37..40) — off the same zeroes, and REFUSED the rotation when it read the
// consumers. `EFFECTS_HASH_GLOBAL` and `TURN_HASH` are 0-pinned HERE and load-bearing in
// `dregg-bilateral-aggregation-v3`: `bilateral_aggregation_air::SCHEDULE_PI_BASE ==
// inner_pi::TURN_HASH_BASE`, so the 49-felt bilateral-schedule contract IS the v1 window
// `[TURN_HASH_BASE, TURN_HASH_BASE + 49)`, and `schedule_block_from_inner_pi` projects it into
// that descriptor's main trace where `window_gate` transitions FORCE the columns and `pi_binding`
// pins them. A zero in the census answers "does any constraint IN THESE TWO REGISTRIES read this
// index" — never "does anything read this slot".
//
// The seven were CONTIGUOUS, which is exactly what made them separable: the schedule window slides
// down by 7 STILL CONTIGUOUS, `SCHEDULE_PI_BASE` cascades symbolically, and the aggregation
// contract is unharmed. Had the cut included 37..40 it would have punched a hole through it.
// `docs/PI-DISPOSITION.md` §6 carries the retraction, the price and the per-slot decision;
// `scripts/pi_disposition_census.py`'s `PROJECTIONS` table now goes RED if that projection stops
// holding, which exists because this mistake was nearly made.
//
// What this re-emitted: every rotation descriptor (Σ piCount 3,821 → 3,429 wide, 3,012 → 2,599
// v3), `WIDE_REGISTRY_STAGED_FP`, `dregg-epoch`'s `registry_fp`, `PROVENANCE.json`, and a VK
// rotation. NOT a re-genesis: `CANONICAL_STATE_SCHEMA_EPOCH` does not move — the compaction rides
// past every `state_commit`. (No number for it here on purpose: this line carried "24" for a few
// hours and the constant was already 26 by the time the emit ran. Read `persist/src/lib.rs`.)

// ---- Stage 7-γ.0a additions: turn-level identity bindings ----
//
// These four fields were designed as values *shared across all per-cell proofs of
// one turn*, with the verifier's cross-proof PI matching loop
// (`verify_proof_carrying_turn_bundle`) enforcing equality across the N proofs.
//
// ⚠ CORRECTED 2026-08-06: THAT LOOP NEVER RAN, and is now deleted. It had one
// caller, which had none. No artifact in the tree carries a bundle of per-cell PI
// vectors to a verifier either, so there is nothing for a cross-proof loop to
// range over. What decides these four today:
//   * FULL NODE — `verify_one_cohort_run` RECONSTRUCTS the whole PI vector from
//     the trusted Turn/Cell/anchors and never deserialises the prover's. Every
//     slot is verifier-authoritative there; an AIR pin would be a subset of what
//     reconstruction already forces.
//   * WIRE — TURN_HASH is compared against a CALLER-SUPPLIED external anchor
//     (`sdk::verify_full_turn_bound`, `dregg_verifier::check_receipt_pi_binding`,
//     `turn::conditional`), always as FOUR felts via `canonical_32_to_felts_4`.
//     ACTOR_NONCE is genuinely pinned (47/56 members) to the state column.
//   * THE BILATERAL AGGREGATION — and this is the half the 2026-08-06 rewrite of
//     this block MISSED, corrected 2026-08-07. `bilateral_aggregation_air::
//     SCHEDULE_PI_BASE == TURN_HASH_BASE` (26 post-compaction, 33 before it):
//     offsets `[TURN_HASH_BASE, TURN_HASH_BASE + 49)` ARE the 49-felt
//     bilateral-schedule contract. `schedule_block_from_inner_pi` projects the
//     window into `dregg-bilateral-aggregation-v3`, whose EMITTED bytes force
//     cols 0..12 (TURN_HASH, EFFECTS_HASH_GLOBAL, ACTOR_NONCE,
//     PREVIOUS_RECEIPT_HASH) with `window_gate` transitions and pin them to its
//     own outer PI. So TURN_HASH and EFFECTS_HASH_GLOBAL are consumed by a
//     deployed AIR — the previous text here, "EFFECTS_HASH_GLOBAL is read by
//     nobody", was false. ⓘ The seven-slot compaction slid that window down by 7
//     INTACT (it kept the schedule block contiguous), which is why it cost the
//     aggregation nothing but a re-emit.
// No EFFECT-VM AIR constraint reads any of the four: `pi_binding` is the only
// constraint kind that reads a public input, and `TURN_HASH_BASE..+8` carry zero
// of them IN THE TWO ROTATION REGISTRIES. That is a statement about those
// descriptors, NOT about the slots — see the aggregation bullet above, and
// `scripts/pi_disposition_census.py`'s `proj-read` column, which exists because
// the distinction was collapsed once and cost a mispriced VK rotation.
// `docs/DESIGN-pi-authority.md` argues the geometry cutover that would have
// pinned TURN_HASH in the effect-VM member is NOT worth doing.

// absorbed into `effects_hash`. But that param was NOT cross-bound to the
// proof that actually enforces the nullifier against the spent note's
// preimage — the `SCHEMA_NOTE_SPEND` binding proof (`effect_action_air`,
// `fields[0]` = the 32-byte nullifier) and `note_spending_witness` (which
// derives the nullifier from the preimage). So a malicious executor could
// prove nullifier N via the spending/binding proof yet feed a DIFFERENT M
// into the EffectVM, and nothing rejected the mismatch.
//
// Approach A closes it with three teeth that all reference the SAME folded
// nullifier:
//   (1) this PI slot — a single felt carrying `fold_bytes32_to_bb(nullifier)`.
//   (2) AIR per-row constraint (air.rs), gated by `sel::NOTE_SPEND`: every
//       NoteSpend row's `param0` MUST equal `PI[NOTESPEND_NULLIFIER]`.
//   (3) ⚠ DOES NOT EXIST. MEASURED 2026-08-02. This tooth was described here as
//       "off-AIR equality (turn::executor::proof_verify): the verifier reconstructs
//       `PI[NOTESPEND_NULLIFIER]` from the SCHEMA_NOTE_SPEND binding proof's `fields[0]`
//       and the PI-match loop rejects any proof whose PI disagrees." No crate performs it.
//       `grep -rn NOTESPEND_NULLIFIER turn/src` matches only an unrelated test NAME
//       (`membership_verifier.rs`), and no crate outside `circuit/` references the constant
//       — not `verifier/`, not `lightclient/`, not `sdk/`. The binding proof does carry the
//       nullifier's RAW 32 bytes in `fields[0]`, but nothing folds them and nothing compares
//       the result to this slot.
//
//       So the count is TWO teeth, not three, and the missing one is the ONLY one that would
//       have tied this felt to the 256-bit source. Approach A's "all reference the SAME
//       folded nullifier" is true of (1) and (2) — which reference each other, in-circuit,
//       and nothing else. Left described-and-absent rather than quietly deleted, because a
//       reader who counted three teeth needs to see which one they were counting.
//
// Single felt (one slot, not 8): matches the in-trace `param0` width the
// AIR already pins. The full 256-bit binding of the nullifier lives in the
// SCHEMA_NOTE_SPEND binding proof (fields[0], 8 limbs) + note_spending_witness;
// this slot is the weld that forbids the EffectVM from spending a different
// nullifier than the one the binding proof certified. Mirrors EMIT_EVENT's
// "first row's value, shared across all matching rows" single-slot shape:
// the per-row gated equality forces every NoteSpend row in one proof to
// share this nullifier (multi-distinct-nullifier proofs need PI extension,
// deferred — same posture as EmitEvent's EMIT_EVENT_COUNT > 1 note).
//
// Sentinel: BabyBear::ZERO when the proof carries no NoteSpend row. A
// NoteSpend whose folded nullifier is genuinely zero is indistinguishable
// from the sentinel, but `fold_bytes32_to_bb` of a real preimage-derived
// nullifier is ~never zero (and the binding proof independently certifies
// the 256-bit value), so the sentinel collision is not an exploit surface.

// THE GAP this closes (mirrors NOTESPEND_NULLIFIER above): the EffectVM's
// NoteCreate row carries `param0` (`param::NOTE_COMMITMENT`) = a single folded
// BabyBear note commitment (`fold_bytes32_to_bb(commitment.0)`), absorbed into
// `effects_hash` and driving the balance DEBIT. But that param was NOT cross-
// bound to the proof that certifies the commitment against its
// value/asset_type/range_proof opening — the `SCHEMA_NOTE_CREATE` binding
// proof (`effect_action_air`, `fields[0]` = the 32-byte commitment). A
// malicious executor could prove commitment C via the binding proof (effect
// at DFS index i) yet feed a DIFFERENT C' into the EffectVM trace; the
// effects_hash reconstruction uses the trace's C' while the binding-proof
// PI-check uses the indexed effect's C, and prior to this slot NOTHING
// cross-checked C == C' — so the debited note creation could be attributed

//   (3) off-AIR equality (turn::executor::proof_verify): the verifier
//       reconstructs `PI[NOTECREATE_COMMITMENT]` from the SCHEMA_NOTE_CREATE
//       binding proof's `fields[0]` and the PI-match loop rejects any proof
//       whose PI disagrees.

// THE GAP this closes: the EffectVM's Burn row carries `param0`
// (`param::BURN_TARGET`) = a single folded BabyBear target-cell id
// (`fold_bytes32_to_bb(target.as_bytes())`). The Burn row's balance-debit
// constraint operates on the trace's RUNNING balance, but the *which cell*
// the burn applies to is what the `SCHEMA_BURN` binding proof certifies the
// algebraic `old_balance - new_balance == amount` relation against
// (`fields[0]` = the 32-byte target cell id, validated against the ledger
// snapshot in `extract_burn_binding_params`). Prior to this slot, a malicious
// executor could supply a SCHEMA_BURN proof for the balance math of target T
// yet feed a Burn for a DIFFERENT target T' into the EffectVM — nothing
// welded the EffectVM's burn target to the cell whose balance arithmetic the
// binding proof actually validated.
//
// ⚠ **NONE OF D5c's THREE TEETH EXIST AT HEAD** (felt-width #25, verified by
// direct read + the committed descriptor bytes — do not re-derive the closure
// from this block's history):

//       rotated PI vector is `pis[..V1_PI_COUNT]` + 4 pins, so offset 200 is
//       NOT PUBLISHED on the leg any verifier sees.
//   (2) the AIR per-row constraint `s_burn·(param0 − PI[BURN_TARGET_PI])` —
//       RETIRED with the v1 hand-AIR (`air.rs` header: "`EffectVmAir` + its
//       `StarkAir` impl is RETIRED"). The Lean-authored deployed descriptor
//       (`EffectVmEmitBurn.burnVmDescriptor`, piCount 42) has no gate, hash
//       site or PI binding over param0, and the live registry member
//       `burnVmDescriptor2R24` references trace col 68 (`PARAM_BASE + 0`)
//       ZERO times. The burn target is an UNCONSTRAINED witness column.
//   (3) the off-AIR equality — there is none. `TurnExecutor::expected_burn_target_limbs` was the
//       dead-code stub that would have carried it; it had zero call sites and was DELETED in the
//       canonical-codec Stage 0 sweep, so nothing off-AIR compares the target either.
// The only carrier the target actually reaches is `compute_effects_hash` (all
// 8 limbs since the #25 widening), and the deployed descriptor binds none of

// work — must anchor the 8 limbs, not this slot.
