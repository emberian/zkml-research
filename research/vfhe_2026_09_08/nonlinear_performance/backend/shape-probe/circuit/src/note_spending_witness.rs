//! Note spending circuit: ZK proof that the spender knows the spending key.
//!
//! # DEPRECATION NOTICE
//!
//! This AIR is **superseded for proof-to-action binding purposes** by the
//! schema-based generalized AIR in `effect_action_air.rs`:
//!   - `SCHEMA_NOTE_SPEND` (full-fidelity binding for `Effect::NoteSpend`)
//!   - `SCHEMA_NOTE_CREATE` (full-fidelity binding for `Effect::NoteCreate`)
//!
//! The legacy AIR below pins `nullifier`/`merkle_root`/`value`/`asset_type`
//! as **single BabyBear felts** (Poseidon2-compressed digests, ~31 bits
//! each). That suffices for spend-side semantics (knowledge of spending
//! key + Merkle membership) but provides only felt-sized binding to a
//! verifier asking "which 32-byte nullifier was spent?".
//!
//! The schema-based AIRs in `effect_action_air.rs` carry every 32-byte
//! field as 8 × 4-byte BabyBear limbs (~248-bit binding) and every u64
//! amount as 2 × 32-bit limbs (full 64-bit binding). New code SHOULD
//! prefer them for action binding. The spend-side semantics half of the
//! legacy AIR (key knowledge + Merkle membership) can continue to live
//! here, or migrate to a dedicated key/membership AIR; only the binding
//! role moves.
//!
//! # Original docs
//!
//! This AIR proves:
//! 1. Prover knows `spending_key` (8 BabyBear limbs = 248 bits) such that
//!    `nullifier = poseidon2(commitment || spending_key[0..8] || creation_nonce)`
//! 2. Prover knows `owner`, `value`, `asset_type`, `creation_nonce`, `randomness` such that
//!    `commitment = poseidon2(owner || value || asset_type || creation_nonce || randomness)`
//! 3. The commitment is a member of a Merkle tree with a given root (Poseidon2 Merkle path)
//!
//! # Trace layout
//!
//! The trace is organized as a sequence of rows with width = 19:
//!
//! ```text
//! Row type: COMMITMENT (rows 0)
//!   col 0: owner
//!   col 1: value
//!   col 2: asset_type
//!   col 3: creation_nonce
//!   col 4: (zero — reserved for Merkle position validity constraint)
//!   col 5: commitment (computed = poseidon2_hash(owner, value, asset_type, creation_nonce, randomness))
//!   col 6..13: spending_key[0..8] (8 BabyBear limbs = 248 bits of security)
//!   col 14: nullifier (computed = poseidon2_hash(commitment, spending_key[0..8], creation_nonce))
//!   col 15: randomness
//!   col 16: is_merkle (0 for this row)
//!   col 17..18: unused (zero)
//!
//! Row type: MERKLE_LEVEL (rows 1..depth)
//!   col 0: current hash at this level
//!   col 1: sibling[0]
//!   col 2: sibling[1]
//!   col 3: sibling[2]
//!   col 4: position (0..3)
//!   col 5: parent = poseidon2_hash_4_to_1(children arranged by position)
//!   col 6..18: unused (zero)
//! ```
//!
//! # Public inputs
//!
//! - `nullifier`: The revealed nullifier (verifier sees this)
//! - `merkle_root`: The Merkle tree root (verifier sees this)
//! - `value`: The note value (verifier sees this — prevents value inflation)
//! - `asset_type`: The note asset type (verifier sees this — prevents asset substitution)
//! - `destination_federation`: Target federation identity, as a BabyBear felt
//!   (prevents cross-federation replay of bridge proofs). For non-bridge spends,
//!   set this to `BabyBear::ZERO`; the AIR pins the trace column to whatever
//!   the prover put in pi[4] so the verifier can require a specific value.
//!
//! # Security properties
//!
//! - The spending key is 248 bits (8 × 31-bit BabyBear limbs), requiring ~2^248 brute-force attempts
//! - The spending key is private (only in the witness, never in public inputs)
//! - The note owner is private (only in the witness)
//! - Value and asset_type are public inputs, bound by boundary constraints to the
//!   trace columns that participate in commitment recomputation. A spender cannot
//!   claim a different value/asset_type than what is committed in the note.
//! - Soundness: a cheating prover must break Poseidon2 collision resistance
//!
//! # Companion AIR: `bridge_action_witness` (DELETED 2026-08-07)
//!
//! Each 32-byte field in this AIR's PI vector (`nullifier`, `merkle_root`,
//! `destination_federation`) lives in a **single** BabyBear slot — the prover
//! compresses the 32 bytes via `bytes_to_babybear` (Poseidon2 of 8 limbs).
//! That compression is sufficient for the spending-key + Merkle proof's
//! binding, but for bridge mints the destination wants algebraic guarantees
//! at full 32-byte fidelity on (nullifier, recipient, destination_federation)
//! and at full 64-bit fidelity on amount. The sibling AIR
//! `crate::bridge_action_witness::BridgeActionAir` provided exactly that — 8 limbs
//! per 32-byte field and 4 × 16-bit limbs for the u64 amount. ⚑ It was 2 × 32-bit
//! until 2026-08-06, which was not "full fidelity" at all — `p < 2^32`, so
//! `BabyBear::new` reduced and `amount` collided with `amount + p`. Two felts
//! cannot injectively carry a u64 (`p² < 2^64`); see that module's flag-day note.
//!
//! ⚠ The companion binds the prover's CLAIMED tuple; it does not attest that the
//! spend happened. That is this AIR's job, and `BridgeBindingFromFold.lean`
//! refuses the companion as a bridge-mint backing on its own.
