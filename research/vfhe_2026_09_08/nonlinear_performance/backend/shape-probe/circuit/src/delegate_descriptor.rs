//! IR-v2 **delegation-binding** descriptor (`dregg-delegate::v2`) — the descriptor-world twin of the
//! executor's `StarkDelegation` scope-binding check.
//!
//! ## What this closes
//!
//! A `DelegationProofData::StarkDelegation` bearer proof authorizes a turn only if the STARK it
//! carries commits to the CANONICAL scope vector for the grant being exercised. The executor
//! enforces exactly that in `turn/src/action.rs::verify_stark_delegation_binding` — it recomputes the
//! expected public inputs
//!
//! ```text
//!   root_issuer_commitment (8 limbs) ‖ target (8 limbs) ‖ scope_hash (8 limbs)     [24 felts]
//! ```
//!
//! (`stark_delegation_expected_public_inputs`) and requires `proof.public_inputs[i] == expected[i]`
//! for every limb (`action.rs:672-685`). A relayed proof minted for a NARROWER grant (different
//! target/permission/expiry/federation/root-issuer) commits to a different scope vector, so the
//! elementwise check fails and the wider grant is refused.
//!
//! The StarkProof→descriptor migration re-expresses that binding as an [`EffectVmDescriptor2`]:
//! [`delegate_binding_descriptor`] pins each of the 24 scope limbs to its public input via a row-0
//! `PiBinding`, so `verify_vm_descriptor2(desc, proof, expected_scope)` succeeds iff the proof was
//! minted for exactly `expected_scope` — the IDENTICAL relay-forge check `action.rs:672-685` runs, now
//! bound in-circuit rather than by an executor-side field compare. A proof bound to scope `A` fails to
//! verify against any forged wider scope `B` (the row-0 boundary `col_i == PI_i` is UNSAT).
//!
//! ## Lean-emit alignment (a NAMED residual)
//!
//! Unlike the other by-name goldens, this descriptor is built directly in Rust — the Lean
//! `EffectVmEmitDelegate.lean` family authors the cap-graph `cap_root`-MOVE `EffectVmDescriptor` (the
//! *effect* of delegating), NOT an `emitVmJson2` IR-v2 golden for the *scope binding* the executor's
//! `StarkDelegation` arm checks. Emitting this scope-binding descriptor from Lean (a byte-pinned
//! `emitVmJson2` `#guard` + emit-gate, like `adjacency-membership.json`) is out of Rust scope and is
//! carried as a residual; the Rust descriptor here captures precisely the `action.rs:672-685`
//! constraints so consumers can flip off the StarkProof path today.
