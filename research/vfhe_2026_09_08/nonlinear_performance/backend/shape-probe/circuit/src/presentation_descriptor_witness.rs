//! Rust witness builder for the emitted **presentation** descriptor
//! (`dregg-presentation-freshness::summary-v1`, authored in
//! `metatheory/Dregg2/Circuit/Emit/PresentationEmit.lean` as `presentationFreshnessDesc`).
//!
//! ## What this closes (the Gate-1.5 pattern for the blinded-presentation family)
//!
//! The StarkProof→descriptor-prover migration flips the anonymous-presentation verifiers (the
//! `bridge` issuer path; `sdk::verify_anonymous_presentation` is the SDK's face on it and, measured
//! 2026-08-06, has ZERO call sites — so read it as an available surface, not as a live consumer)
//! from the hand `PresentationAir` STARK onto the p3 descriptor prover. The emitted descriptor for
//! this family is
//! [`crate::descriptor_by_name::descriptor_by_name`]`("dregg-presentation-freshness::summary-v1")`:
//! the 19-column summary copy PLUS the one off-AIR check that is a
//! self-contained arithmetic tooth — the FRESHNESS binding (`verify_freshness_binding`).
//!
//! ⚑ **This is now the ONLY summary AIR for the family** (2026-08-06). The hand
//! `impl Air for PresentationAir` the summary copies were transcribed from is DELETED: every one
//! of its nineteen `row[i] - pi[i]` constraints evaluated `0 - 0`, because its own
//! `generate_trace` returned `public_inputs = row.clone()`. It had no caller of any kind, so it
//! was dead weight rather than a live hole — but the constraints HERE are the ones that bite, and
//! they bite because these public inputs come from the WIRE.
//! (The `presentation.rs:807` / `presentation.rs:316` line cites that used to sit here had both
//! drifted — the real homes are `:651` and `:385` — which is why they are gone: a line number is a
//! claim that rots, a symbol name is not.) Until now the only Rust producer of a
//! descriptor-matching trace for it lived inside `circuit-prove/tests/presentation_emit_gate.rs`;
//! there was NO production witness builder (the analog of [`crate::membership_descriptor_4ary::membership_witness_4ary`])
//! that consumers of `descriptor_by_name` could call. This module is that builder.
//!
//! ## Note on "blinded" (the hint's blinded-Merkle ring membership)
//!
//! The blinded issuer Merkle membership itself (`blinded_merkle_poseidon2_circuit`,
//! `BLINDED_MERKLE_AIR_NAME`) is NOT internalized into an IR-v2 descriptor — per the
//! `FITS_WITH_NAMED_GATE` verdict it rides as a NAMED STARK leaf that the executor verifies
//! (`PresentationEmit.lean` §"The NAMED gates"). So the family's emitted, byte-pinned descriptor is
//! the summary+freshness one built here; there is no separate `dregg-blinded-merkle::*`
//! `EffectVmDescriptor2` to witness (that would be a distinct future emit, not a present descriptor).
//!
//! ## The trace layout (a single logical row, repeated to a power-of-two height)
//!
//! | col     | name                       | meaning                                                       |

//! | 1..8    | request_predicate          | PI 1..8 (`ACTION_BINDING_WIDTH = 8`)                        |
//! | 9       | timestamp                  | PI 9                                                         |
//! | 10      | presentation_tag           | PI 10 (its hash well-formedness is a named STARK leaf)      |
//! | 11..18  | revealed_facts_commitment  | PI 11..18 (`WideHash::WIDTH = 8`)                           |
//! | 19      | verifier_block_height      | PI 19 (the public freshness anchor)                         |
//! | 20      | not_after_height           | published by the named derivation leaf (bound to diff)      |
//! | 21      | diff = not_after − verifier | range-proved into `[0, 2^30)`                              |
//! | 22      | hi = p/2 − diff            | range-proved into `[0, 2^30)` (closes the exact `p/2` bound) |
//!
//! The two freshness gates (`diff = not_after − verifier`, `diff + hi = p/2`) are filled to hold by
//! construction; the descriptor's TWO `Range{30}` lookups on `diff` and `hi` are the JUDGE. This
//! builder is mechanical — it does NOT pre-judge freshness. An EXPIRED token (`not_after < verifier`)
//! yields `diff = p − (verifier − not_after)`, out of `[0, 2^30)` → the `diff` range is UNSAT; a
//! `diff > p/2` (yet `< 2^30`) forces `hi = p/2 − diff` to wrap to `p − …` → the `hi` range is UNSAT
//! (the EXACT non-power-of-two `p/2` bound). This reproduces `verify_freshness_binding`'s deployed
//! acceptance region `diff ∈ [0, 1_006_632_960]` exactly (asserted against the deployed constant in
//! the tests).
