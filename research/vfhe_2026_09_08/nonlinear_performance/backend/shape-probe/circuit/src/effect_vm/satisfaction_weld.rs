//! # `satisfaction_weld` — the IN-AIR capacity-gate satisfaction constraints (PIECE 2 of the VK
//! epoch, STAGED).
//!
//! `docs/deos/VK-EPOCH-CONSTRAINT-BINDING-DESIGN.md` §6 names two halves of the house-capacity
//! light-client weld:
//!
//!  * **COVERAGE** (PIECE 1) — the capacity manifest entry cannot be OMITTED. Done + deployed: the
//!    rotated caveat carrier (`caveatCommit` → PI 45) binds the manifest into the ~124-bit wide
//!    commit, so a pure light client witnesses presence (`trace_rotated::slot_caveats_to_rotated_manifest`
//!    + `verify::verify_rotated_caveat_coverage`; Lean `Dregg2.Deos.CapacityCarrier`).
//!
//!  * **SATISFACTION** (PIECE 2, THIS module) — the gate must have HELD over the COMMITTED state.
//!    Today the deployed off-AIR re-evaluation (`verify::verify_slot_caveat_manifest`, the
//!    `SETTLE_ESCROW` arm) reads CALLER-supplied `initial_fields`/`final_fields` 8-felt slot views; a
//!    pure light client does not bind those. This module is the genuinely-VK-affecting fix: the
//!    gate's slot reads are expressed as IN-AIR `VmConstraint::Gate` constraints over the rotated
//!    BEFORE/AFTER state-block FIELD columns (`r3..r10`, the `trace_rotated::fill_block` welds), which
//!    the chained `wireCommitR` → state-commit absorbs into the wide commit. A satisfying proof then
//!    FORCES the gate over the committed state.
//!
//! ## STAGED — built BESIDE the deployed, NOT flipped, NOT yet in a committed VK
//!
//! These constraints are NOT yet emitted into a committed welded descriptor / VK and NOT routed onto
//! any live path. They are the constraint polynomials a staged `settleEscrowSatVmDescriptor2R24` would
//! carry; assembling that descriptor (its Lean emit keystone), committing its VK, and flipping the
//! live path through it is the remaining gated VK epoch (the design doc §6 remaining + flip plan).
//! Until that flip, satisfaction is NOT light-client-witnessed — only a verifier holding the
//! committed-state opening witnesses it (the cap-membership posture). The Lean rung proving these
//! constraints carry pure-light-client satisfaction is `Dregg2.Deos.CapacitySatisfaction`
//! (`satisfaction_witnessed` + the composed `capacity_witnessed_pure_lightclient`).
//!
//! ## The constraint shape
//!
//! Each gate is a selector-gated row-local equality `sel · (col − const) == 0` (degree 2), inert when
//! the capacity selector `sel` is 0 (padding / non-capacity rows), and forcing the field equality when
//! `sel = 1`. The sealed-escrow gate (the Lean `SettleFieldGate`) is FOUR such gates: both legs
//! `Deposited` in the BEFORE block, both `Consumed` in the AFTER block.
