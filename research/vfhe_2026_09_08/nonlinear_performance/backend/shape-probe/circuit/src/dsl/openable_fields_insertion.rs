//! The openable-`fields_root` IN-CIRCUIT INSERTION gate (the REFUSAL
//! ledgerless-authority close, #103): a STARK that
//!
//! ```text
//! post_root = insert(pre_root, key → value)
//! ```
//!
//! is FORCED in-circuit — the post-root is DERIVED from the pre-root + the
//! public `(key, value)`, NOT anchored off-circuit from a trusted post-cell.
//!
//! ## Why this exists (the gap it closes)
//!
//! `refusal`'s authority change writes an audit record into the
//! protocol-reserved `fields_root` key (`REFUSAL_AUDIT_EXT_KEY`). The deployed
//! `fields_root` is a sponge over the WHOLE map, so the post-root depends on
//! every entry — today the verifier recomputes it OFF-CIRCUIT from the trusted
//! post-cell (`Anchor::RecordDigest`). With the openable
//! [`crate::openable_fields_root::OpenableFieldsTree`] representation, the
//! post-root is the single-leaf insertion of `(key, value)` into the pre-root,
//! and THIS circuit proves that insertion: a ledgerless client supplies the
//! pre-root and the PUBLIC `(key, value)` (for refusal, the public audit felt),
//! and the proof alone binds the post-root.
//!
//! ## The statement (depth = [`FIELDS_TREE_DEPTH`], binary `cap_node` nodes)
//!
//! The trace is exactly `FIELDS_TREE_DEPTH` rows (16), one per tree level,
//! bottom-up. Each row carries TWO Merkle folds that ride the SAME witnessed
//! sibling and the SAME direction bit — the OLD fold (recomputing `pre_root`
//! from the old leaf digest) and the NEW fold (recomputing `post_root` from the
//! new leaf digest `hash[key, value]`):
//!
//! ```text
//! row r:  cur_old_r ∈ {left_old_r, right_old_r}   (selected by dir_r)
//!         cur_new_r ∈ {left_new_r, right_new_r}   (SAME dir_r)
//!         sibling_r is the SHARED sibling at level r (occupies the OTHER slot
//!                   in BOTH the old and the new node hash)
//!         parent_old_r = cap_node(left_old_r, right_old_r)   (in-circuit P2)
//!         parent_new_r = cap_node(left_new_r, right_new_r)   (in-circuit P2)
//!         cur_old_{r+1} = parent_old_r        (chain continuity, old)
//!         cur_new_{r+1} = parent_new_r        (chain continuity, new)
//! row 0:  cur_old_0 = pi[OLD_LEAF]            (old leaf digest)
//!         cur_new_0 = pi[NEW_LEAF]            (new leaf digest = hash[key,value])
//! last:   parent_old = pi[PRE_ROOT]
//!         parent_new = pi[POST_ROOT]
//! ```
//!
//! ## Why the post-root is DERIVED, not a free column (the soundness core)
//!
//! The post-root is NOT a witnessed wire the prover sets freely. It is the
//! last-row `parent_new` boundary, and `parent_new` at each level is the
//! in-circuit `cap_node` of the new child and the SHARED sibling — the SAME
//! sibling that, in the OLD fold, hashes up to `pi[PRE_ROOT]`. So:
//!
//!   * the OLD fold pins the witnessed sibling path against `pre_root`
//!     (a tampered sibling tops a different `pre_root`, rejected by the
//!     `PRE_ROOT` boundary);
//!   * the NEW fold reuses those SAME sibling columns and the SAME direction
//!     bits (forced equal across the two folds — there is ONE `sibling` and ONE
//!     `dir` column per row), so `post_root` is uniquely the insertion of the
//!     new leaf at the position the old leaf occupied.
//!
//! A prover who publishes a `post_root` that is NOT the genuine insertion has
//! no satisfying assignment: the only freedom is the sibling path, and that is
//! pinned by the `pre_root` boundary. This is the [`crate::cap_membership`]
//! pattern (membership-open against a pinned root) run TWICE over ONE path.
//! All constraints are forms the audited `prove_dsl_p3` / `verify_dsl_p3` path
//! arithmetizes for real (the node hashes via `Hash3Cap`); the proof carries a
//! REAL terminal FRI low-degree test.
