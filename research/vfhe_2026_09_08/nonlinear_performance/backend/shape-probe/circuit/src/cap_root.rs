//! The canonical, **openable** capability-set commitment: a SORTED Poseidon2
//! binary Merkle tree over a cell's c-list.
//!
//! ## Why this module exists (audit P0-3 / cap Phase A)
//!
//! The cell crate's `compute_canonical_capability_root` was a BLAKE3 XOR-fold,
//! while the EffectVM circuit's `cap_root` column was a Poseidon2 fold
//! initialized to `BabyBear::ZERO` and advanced by per-effect edge-mutations.
//! The two were **disjoint**: the prover seeded the circuit's `cap_root` from
//! ZERO, never from the cell's real capability root, so nothing tied the
//! circuit-side capability digest to the authoritative c-list. An openable
//! membership proof (Phase B: in-circuit non-amplification / authority gates)
//! had no shared root to open against.
//!
//! This module supplies the **single** capability-root scheme, computed
//! byte-identically wherever it runs:
//!
//!   * `dregg-cell`'s `compute_canonical_capability_root` calls
//!     [`compute_capability_root`] (cell → circuit, the only direction the
//!     dependency graph permits — circuit's dep on cell is dev-only).
//!   * The EffectVM circuit seeds its `cap_root` column from the same value
//!     (`CellState::new` / the node + cipherclerk prover paths).
//!
//! Because there is exactly ONE implementation, the cell-side root and the
//! circuit-side seed are identical by construction; the differential test
//! `circuit/tests/cap_root_cell_circuit_differential.rs` is the guard that pins
//! it (the A2 gate).
//!
//! ## The scheme (the sorted, sentinel-bracketed openable-tree family)
//!
//! A SORTED binary Merkle tree over the c-list, **keyed by `slot_hash`** (the
//! slot is unique per c-list — the executor's `validate_capability_uniqueness`
//! enforces it — so the key is injective: exactly one leaf per slot). The
//! keys are sorted, deduplicated, and bracketed by the
//! [`SENTINEL_MIN`](crate::heap_root::SENTINEL_MIN) /
//! [`SENTINEL_MAX`](crate::heap_root::SENTINEL_MAX) sentinels, BOTH STORED AS LEAVES
//! (so a Phase-B non-membership proof can bracket any absent key by physical
//! adjacency). The tree is padded to `2^DEPTH` positions; internal nodes are
//! `hash_fact(left, [right])` — the SAME node hash [`crate::heap_root`] uses.
//!
//! ⚠ THE FAMILY DIVERGED — do not carry a fact from the heap tree by analogy. On
//! 2026-07-12 (`919b2b0b8d`) the HEAP tree became an indexed Merkle tree: its leaf is the
//! arity-3 `hash[addr, value, next_addr]` and it stores ONE sentinel leaf
//! ([`crate::heap_root::HEAP_SENTINEL_LEAVES`]), MAX surviving only as the terminal
//! pointer. THIS tree still stores both, which is exactly why its trailing-pad exposure
//! is the weaker [`crate::heap_root::assert_pad_free_tail`] condition rather than the
//! heap's structural `addr < next_addr` guard. Shared today: the sentinel CONSTANTS, the
//! node hash, the depth, the sparse-prefix fold. NOT shared: the leaf schema, the
//! occupancy, the real capacity (`2^DEPTH - 2` here, `2^DEPTH - 1` for the heap).
//!
//! Each leaf is `Poseidon2(slot_hash, target, auth_tag, mask_lo, mask_hi,
//! expiry, breadstuff)` — the 7 [`CapLeaf`] fields:
//!
//!   * `slot_hash`  — the sort key, a Poseidon2 image of the c-list slot.
//!   * `target`     — the capability's target cell id, folded to one felt.
//!   * `auth_tag`   — the `AuthRequired` tier byte (None=0…Custom=5) with the
//!     8 vk_hash limbs absorbed for the `Custom` case (mirrors the cell's
//!     `hash_auth_required_into`), so two `Custom`s with distinct vk_hashes
//!     yield distinct leaves.
//!   * `mask_lo` / `mask_hi` — the `EffectMask` (u32) split low-16 / high-16
//!     (two 16-bit limbs, NOT one 30-bit limb — `EFFECT_ALL = 0xFFFF_FFFF`
//!     needs the full 32 bits).
//!   * `expiry`     — the optional expiry height (`None` is a reserved sentinel
//!     distinct from any finite height).
//!   * `breadstuff` — the optional capability-token hash, folded to one felt
//!     (`None` reserved). Included because two caps differing only in
//!     breadstuff must not collide.
//!
//! ## Phase A scope
//!
//! Phase A makes the `cap_root` VALUE this sorted-Merkle root and seeds the
//! circuit column from the real cell root. The per-effect `cap_root` ADVANCE
//! stays pinned-as-digest (the circuit pins the executor's computed new root;
//! it does NOT yet recompute the sorted-tree update in-circuit), and there are
//! NO in-circuit membership-open / submask / non-amplification gates yet —
//! those are Phase B.
