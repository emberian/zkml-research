//! Effect VM AIR: Multi-row DSL circuit proving arbitrary sequences of effects
//! (turns) in a single STARK proof.
//!
//! Inspired by o1vm (RISC-V execution trace proving), but for dregg Effects instead
//! of CPU instructions. Each trace row represents one effect execution step.
//!
//! # Instruction Set (Effect Types)
//!
//! - NoOp (0): Padding effect; all constraints trivially satisfied.
//! - Transfer (1): Balance transfer with direction (in/out).
//! - SetField (2): Update a custom field slot.
//! - GrantCapability (3): Cross-cell delegation. direction 0 = recipient
//!   install (capability_root update); direction 1 = granter-side delegation
//!   row (cap Phase B2: held membership-open + non-amp gates, cap_root
//!   passthrough).
//! - NoteSpend (4): Spend a note (nullifier reveal, balance credit).
//! - NoteCreate (5): Create a note (commitment creation, BALANCE-NEUTRAL — the
//!   note value lives in the commitment, never on the transparent ledger).
//! - CreateObligation (6): Lock stake from balance as a bonded obligation.
//! - FulfillObligation (7): Return locked stake on successful fulfillment.
//! - Custom (8): CellProgram dispatch — state flows unchanged, domain constraints
//!   proven externally. Params carry program VK hash + proof commitment.
//! - SlashObligation (9): Slash an expired obligation.
//! - Seal (10): Lock a field against mutation.
//! - Unseal (11): Unlock a sealed field.
//! - MakeSovereign (12): Transition cell from managed to sovereign.
//! - CreateCellFromFactory (13): Record factory provenance.
//! - ExportSturdyRef (14): Export cell as sturdy ref (CapTP).
//! - EnlivenRef (15): Enliven a sturdy ref (CapTP).
//! - DropRef (16): Drop a remote reference / GC decrement (CapTP).
//! - ValidateHandoff (17): Validate a handoff certificate (CapTP).
//! - AllocateQueue (18): Create a new MerkleQueue (storage Phase 2).
//! - EnqueueMessage (19): Append message to queue (storage Phase 2).
//! - DequeueMessage (20): Advance queue head, reveal message (storage Phase 2).
//! - ResizeQueue (21): Change queue capacity (storage Phase 2).
//! - AtomicQueueTx (22): Prove atomic cross-queue transaction (storage Phase 3).
//! - PipelineStep (23): Prove pipeline step correctly routed a message (storage Phase 3).
//! - Burn (46): Explicit non-conservation balance reduction (near-miss aliasing closure).
//! - CellDestroy (47): Permanently retire a cell (near-miss aliasing closure).
//! - AttenuateCapability (48): Narrow a c-list cap (near-miss aliasing closure).
//! - CellSeal (49): Transition cell lifecycle to Sealed (AIR-impl lane #119).
//! - CellUnseal (50): Reverse a cell seal (AIR-impl lane #119).
//! - ReceiptArchive (51): Summarize receipt-chain prefix (AIR-impl lane #119).
//! - Refusal (52): Evidence-of-absence attestation (AIR-impl lane #119).

//! # Trace Layout (one row per effect)
//!
//! ```text
//! | selector[24] | state_before[14] | effect_params[8] | state_after[14] | aux[11] |
//! ```
//!
//! Total width: 71 columns
//!
//! ## Column Breakdown
//!
//! Selectors (cols 0..9): Exactly one active per row.
//!   - sel_noop, sel_transfer, sel_setfield, sel_grantcap, sel_notespend, sel_notecreate,
//!     sel_create_obligation, sel_fulfill_obligation, sel_custom
//!
//! State Before (cols 9..23):
//!   - balance_lo, balance_hi (u64 as two BabyBear limbs, 30+34 bits)
//!   - nonce
//!   - field_values[0..7] (8 custom fields)
//!   - capability_root
//!   - state_commitment (running Poseidon2 hash of full state)
//!   - reserved
//!
//! Effect Params (cols 23..31):
//!   - param0..param7 (meaning depends on effect type)
//!
//! State After (cols 31..45):
//!   - Same layout as state_before
//!
//! Aux (cols 50..61):
//!   - Auxiliary witness values (intermediate hashes, commitment tree nodes)
//!   - aux[8..10]: state commitment tree intermediates (hash_4_to_1 outputs)
//!
//! # Constraints
//!
//! 1. Selector exclusivity: sum(selectors) == 1, each selector is boolean.
//! 2. Per-effect constraints (gated by selector):
//!    - Transfer: new_balance = old_balance +/- amount
//!    - SetField: one field updated, others unchanged
//!    - GrantCap: capability_root = hash(old_root, new_entry)
//!    - NoteSpend: nullifier valid, balance increases
//!    - NoteCreate: commitment valid, balance UNCHANGED (balance-neutral; the
//!      value is hidden in the commitment, never moved on the transparent ledger)
//!    - CreateObligation: balance decreases by stake_amount
//!    - FulfillObligation: balance increases by stake_return
//!    - Custom: state unchanged (domain constraints proven externally)
//! 3. Transition constraints (row-to-row continuity):
//!    - next_row.state_before == this_row.state_after
//!    - next_row.nonce == this_row.nonce + 1 (or same for NoOp padding)
//! 4. Boundary constraints:
//!    - First row: state_before matches old_commitment (public input)
//!    - Last non-padding row: state_after matches new_commitment
//!    - Conservation: net balance delta == public input
//!
//! # Public Inputs
//!
//! Base layout: `pi::ACTIVE_BASE_COUNT` felts, then the per-custom-effect entries.
//!
//! ⚑ **A TABLE OF ABSOLUTE OFFSETS USED TO SIT HERE, AND IT WAS WRONG BY 8 FOR MONTHS.** It
//! opened `[0..4] OLD_COMMIT[4]` — the PRE-PHASE-C widths, stale from the day the state
//! commitments went 4 felts → 8, so every number below the third row was low by eight. The
//! 2026-08-07 seven-slot compaction would have made the same table wrong by another seven. The
//! prefix is a pure cascade (`OLD_COMMIT_BASE = 0` is the only literal; every later base is
//! `prior_base + prior_len`), so naming the constants in order is a COMPLETE and drift-proof
//! description and an offset table is not. Read `pi.rs` — its `BASE_COUNT` docblock states the
//! order, and `pi::v3_drift_guard` pins the handful of absolute numbers a reader actually needs
//! against the Lean emission.
//!
//! The one thing worth stating in prose, because it is a decision rather than a layout: the four
//! 7-γ.0a additions (`TURN_HASH`, `EFFECTS_HASH_GLOBAL`, `ACTOR_NONCE`, `PREVIOUS_RECEIPT_HASH`)
//! were designed as values *shared across all per-cell proofs of one turn*, checked for
//! cross-proof equality by `verify_proof_carrying_turn_bundle`.
//!
//! ⚠ **CORRECTED 2026-08-06. That loop never ran and is now deleted.** Measured
//! before removal: `verify_proof_carrying_turn_bundle` had exactly one caller,
//! which itself had zero, so no executor ever compared these four slots across a
//! bundle — and no artifact in the tree carries a bundle of per-cell PI vectors
//! to a verifier in the first place. What actually decides these values today:
//!
//! * On the FULL NODE, `turn::executor::proof_verify::verify_one_cohort_run`
//!   takes no PI vector at all — it RECONSTRUCTS the whole vector from the
//!   trusted `Turn` / before-`Cell` / anchors and verifies against that. Every
//!   slot is verifier-authoritative there, pinned or not; the prover's published
//!   vector is never deserialised.
//! * On the WIRE, `TURN_HASH` is compared against a CALLER-SUPPLIED external
//!   anchor (`sdk::verify_full_turn_bound`'s `expected_turn_hash`,
//!   `dregg_verifier::check_receipt_pi_binding`,
//!   `turn::conditional`), always as FOUR felts via `canonical_32_to_felts_4`.
//! * ⚑ `TURN_HASH` **and** `EFFECTS_HASH_GLOBAL` are also PROOF-BOUND, in another descriptor —
//!   corrected 2026-08-07, and this block previously said the opposite ("`EFFECTS_HASH_GLOBAL`
//!   is read by NOTHING"). They are the first eight felts of the 49-felt bilateral-schedule
//!   window `inner_pi[TURN_HASH_BASE, +49)` that `schedule_block_from_inner_pi` projects into
//!   `dregg-bilateral-aggregation-v3`, where `window_gate` transitions FORCE the columns and
//!   `pi_binding` pins them to that descriptor's own outer PI.
//!
//! No EFFECT-VM AIR constraint reads any of the four: `pi_binding` is the only constraint kind
//! that reads a public input, and those offsets carry zero of them across all 56 deployed wide
//! members — a statement about THOSE descriptors, not about the slots. See
//! `docs/PI-DISPOSITION.md` §6 and `scripts/pi_disposition_census.py`'s `proj-read` column.

// ============================================================================
// Sub-module layout
// ============================================================================
//
// The Effect VM AIR was originally one monolithic 10k-line file. It now
// decomposes by concern:
//   columns   — trace width + per-block column index sub-modules (sel,
//                state, param, aux_off).
//   pi        — public-input slot constants.
//   effect    — the `Effect` enum (one variant per effect type).
//   cell_state — the `CellState` struct + commitment helpers.
//   helpers   — limb split/join, reserved-bit fill, compute_effects_hash[_4].
//   air       — `AIR_DESCRIPTOR`, `EffectVmAir`, `StarkAir` impl.
//   trace     — witness/trace generation + `EffectVmContext`.
//   verify    — verifier-side range / slot-caveat checks.
//   tests     — the (large) #[cfg(test)] module.
//
// External callers see the pre-decomp public surface preserved via
// re-exports below (no path changes needed).
