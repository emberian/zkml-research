# Selvage.Commitment — the vector-commitment (Merkle/BCS) binding layer.

Everything upstream of this file is word-level algebra. `Selvage/Accumulator.lean`
keeps `Root` opaque by design ("that `rt` binds the word is the commitment
layer's obligation"); `Selvage/AccExtract.lean` recovers witnesses from the folded
WORDS, with the words' binding to the prover's roots the named seam
`[ACC-extract-bind]`; `Selvage/Decider.lean` consumes the witness word `f` as
given, with "`rt` opens to this `f`" the named seam `[DEC-open]`. This file IS
that commitment layer: the binding relation between a root and the word it
commits, so "the prover committed to word f" and "the extracted/checked word is
THE committed one" become real statements, and both seams close at the
resolution stated below.

The construction (Merkle/BCS vector commitment, WARP 2025/753 / WHIR 2024/1586
deployment shape, abstracted to its load-bearing content):

* `OpeningScheme` — `commit : (ι → F) → Root`, `openAt` (the Merkle path),
  `verifyOpen : Root → ι → F → Op → Prop` (check one symbol against the root),
  with completeness `verifyOpen_commit` (an honest opening of a committed word
  verifies).
* `PositionBinding` — THE load-bearing property: one root cannot open to two
  different values at one position. Everything extraction and the decider need
  from the commitment is this.
* `BindingCommitment` — an opening scheme CARRYING its binding as a Prop field.

**The honest floor (read before auditing).** Position-binding is not provable
from nothing: for the deployed Merkle/sponge it rests on collision-resistance
of the hash. Following the discipline of `Selvage/FiatShamir.lean`'s ROM (an
INHABITED handler, `Oracle.empty` — never an unproved axiom), the idealization
here is a STRUCTURE with binding as a field, and it is INHABITED:
`idealCommitment`, the identity scheme (`Root := ι → F`, `commit = id`,
`verifyOpen rt i v _ := rt i = v`), has its binding PROVED — a binding scheme
EXISTS, the abstraction is non-vacuous, and no axiom enters the tree. The
deployed sponge realizing `BindingCommitment` is the one named residual
`[COMMIT-CR]` below, priced at deployment exactly like `[FS-ROM]`.

**Transcription notes:**

* **Position-binding is the primitive; word binding is derived.** Merkle
  binding is per-leaf; `word_binding` extends it to whole words by `funext`
  over fully-opened positions, and `opened_eq_committed` specializes to the
  honest root: any word fully opened from `commit w` IS `w`.

* **Resolution: all positions opened.** The seam theorems consume openings at
  EVERY position (`∀ i, verifyOpen …`). In deployment the prover opens `t`
  spot-checked columns and the FULL word is reconstructed by erasure
  correction inside the mutual-agreement set (WARP App. B; mutual correlated
  agreement PROVED at unique decoding in `Selvage/CorrelatedAgreement.lean`).
  That partial-opening lift is obligation (b) of `[ACC-extract-bind]`'s prose
  ledger in `Selvage/AccExtract.lean` and stays THERE; this file closes
  obligations (a) binding and (c) attribution at the stated resolution, and
  says so rather than smuggling the lift into a hypothesis.

* **`verifyOpen` is a Prop, not a program.** The deployed Merkle-path check
  (hash the leaf up the tree, compare to the root) is the `[COMMIT-CR]`
  realizer's job; the seam theorems consume only the relation and its two
  laws. Nothing here is hand-written circuit/AIR material — this is the
  spec-level commitment relation the emit path will eventually refine to.

* **Why the fold algebra never inspected `Root`.** `committed_fold_bind`
  renders the seam at the accumulation step: the prover's recommitment
  (`foldRoot A.rt γ B.rt`) committing the folded word is a HYPOTHESIS relating
  root to word — exactly the datum the opaque-root discipline deferred to this
  layer. The extraction side (`Selvage/AccExtract.lean`'s `extractPair`, which
  consumes folded words `h, h'`) composes with `committed_extract_bind`
  downstream: binding hands extraction the committed words, extraction hands
  back witnesses ATTACHED to the prover's commitments. (The composition is
  stated in the chain lane, which owns the AccExtract import; this file stays
  import-light under it — `Selvage/Depth.lean` is a sibling-lane surface.)

**Keystones** (ATLAS: satisfiable + teeth + premise inhabitation, all BUILT,
computing over F₅): completeness fires on `xWord`; binding FIRES (two values
at one position cannot both verify — generic and computed); the seam theorems
fire on a WARP-shape claim rooted at `commit xWord`; and binding is
LOAD-BEARING — the equivocator (constant commit, accept-everything verify) is
a genuine `OpeningScheme` whose completeness holds, yet it admits NO
`BindingCommitment` extension (`equivocal_no_binding_extension`) and it BREAKS
the seam conclusion (`equivocal_breaks_extract_bind`: one root fully opens to
two different words, so "extracted = committed" fails). Without the `binding`
field the whole attribution story is false, not merely unproved.

the two openings. This is what the deployed Merkle tree buys with

/-- **A binding vector commitment**: an opening scheme carrying its
position-binding as a Prop field. The honest-floor shape: binding rests on

/-! **Forgetting binding, silently.** A `BindingCommitment` may be handed to
anything that needs only `commit`/`openAt`/`verifyOpen`, and the coercion is
definitionally the parent projection — `S.verifyOpen` on either side is the
same term. This exists so that predicates which do NOT consume binding can be
STATED at `OpeningScheme` without a second copy at `BindingCommitment`: the
weaker type is the real home, and every existing binding-typed call site keeps
its syntax. Where binding IS consumed (`bcs_root_pins_word`, `binding_columns`,
`word_binding`) the argument stays a `BindingCommitment` and the coercion never
applies. -/

so a `BindingCommitment` exists only when `Root` is at least as large as the
word space.  A short digest over a larger word space admits none: this is the
same pigeonhole as `Tower256MerkleCardinalityCore.merklePcs_empty_of_positive`,
one level up, and it is why the deployed Merkle root cannot be a

/-! ## The inhabitation — the honest floor is a BUILT object

A binding scheme EXISTS: the identity/injective commitment, `Root := ι → F`,
`commit = id`, `verifyOpen rt i v _ := rt i = v`. Binding is a two-line
theorem (`rt i = v` and `rt i = v'` force `v = v'`). This is the exact
`Oracle.empty` move: the idealized layer is inhabited, so every theorem taking
a `BindingCommitment` has a non-vacuous instance, and no axiom is ever
declared. What the identity scheme idealizes away — succinctness of the root
and the hash realizing it — is `[COMMIT-CR]`'s ledger, not a soundness gap. -/

/-- **The ideal (identity) commitment** — the inhabitation witness of the
honest floor: the root IS the word, verification is symbol equality, binding
is proved. Trivially succinctness-free; the deployed Merkle/sponge scheme
realizing `BindingCommitment` with a short root is `[COMMIT-CR]`. -/

/-! ## Closing the seams: `[ACC-extract-bind]`(a)(c) and `[DEC-open]`

Both seams are the same question asked by two consumers: the algebra holds of
a WORD; the prover supplied a ROOT; is the word the root's? With a
`BindingCommitment` and full openings, yes — and the claim-level conclusion
transfers from the transcript word to THE committed word. -/

section Seams

variable [Field F] {r : ℕ}

/-- **`[ACC-extract-bind]`, the binding + attribution seam closed** (at the
all-positions resolution — module header): if the accumulated claim's root
commits `w` and the word `e` the extraction algebra worked on fully opens from
that root, then `e` IS `w`, and satisfaction of the claim transfers to the
committed word. Word-level extraction (`Selvage/AccExtract.lean`: witnesses
recovered from and bound to the folded words) + this theorem = witnesses
attached to the prover's COMMITMENTS, not merely to algebraically consistent
words. The deep step is one application of `binding` (via
`opened_eq_committed`); the `t`-column erasure lift remains
`[ACC-extract-bind]`(b) upstream. -/

/-- The seam at the ACCUMULATION STEP, where extraction operates: the prover's
recommitment `foldRoot A.rt γ B.rt` (WARP recommits the folded word every
step) committing `w`, plus full openings of the transcript's folded word `h`,
force `h = w` — the folded word `extractPair` consumes at this challenge IS
the recommitted one. This is why `foldClaims` could keep `Root` opaque: the
root–word relation enters here, once, as commitment data. -/

/-- **`[DEC-open]`, closed** (same resolution): the decider's checked word,
fully opened from the final accumulator's root, IS the committed word — so
`D_ACC`'s verdict on the opened word is a verdict on THE word `rt` binds,
which is the contract `Selvage/Decider.lean` stated itself conditional on. -/

/-! ## Keystones (ATLAS law 2: satisfiable + teeth + premise inhabitation)

All BUILT, computing over F₅, reusing `RSExample` (`xWord`, `dom₅`) and
`AccExample` (`oneWord`, `q2`, `consv`):

* **satisfiable** — `ideal_commit_opens` / `ideal_open_computes`: commit a
  concrete word, open a position, verification succeeds (by completeness, and
  again by kernel computation).
* **teeth, binding fires** — `ideal_binding_fires` (generic: two distinct
  values never both verify) and `ideal_binding_computes` (the concrete
  refutation computed); `seam_teeth`: the DIFFERENT word `oneWord` cannot be
  fully opened from `commit xWord` — equivocation against an honest root is
  impossible for the ideal scheme.
* **premise inhabitation** — `committed_extract_bind_fires` /
  `decider_open_fires`: both seam theorems fire on a WARP-shape claim rooted
  at a real commitment, every hypothesis discharged by built objects
  (`ideal_decider_accepts` runs the decider on it by `decide`).
* **binding is load-bearing** — the equivocator `equivocal` (constant commit,
  accept-everything verify) IS an `OpeningScheme` with completeness proved,
  but: `equivocal_not_binding` refutes its position-binding;
  `equivocal_no_binding_extension` shows NO `BindingCommitment` has it as its
  opening scheme (the missing field cannot be filled); and
  `equivocal_breaks_extract_bind` exhibits the seam conclusion FAILING for it
  — one root fully opens to two different words, so "extracted = committed"
  is false, not merely unproved. The `binding` field is exactly what stands
  between the stack and that counterexample. -/

/-! ## Residual obligation — prose, not a stub

Named residual with its realizer; it becomes a real theorem, never a
`def : Prop := True` (the audit discipline).

**[COMMIT-CR] — cannot land in this type.**  `BindingCommitment.isEmpty_of_card_lt`:
a `BindingCommitment` with a root smaller than its word space does not exist,
so no hash assumption can realize one.  The compressing commitment is
`Theory.AuthMap`, whose soundness is the reduction
`Scheme.forgery_exhibits_collision`; `Selvage/AuthMapCommitment.lean` restates
the seams below over it, and `Assurance/SelvageV0.lean`'s capstone consumes
that form.  Everything in this file about `BindingCommitment` is a statement
about non-compressing commitments (the identity scheme and injections into an
unbounded root).  The paragraph below is the original residual, kept for
the record of what was asked for.  In deployment `Root` is a short digest: `commit` Merkle-hashes the word with the
stack's sponge (the same hash family `[FS-ROM]` idealizes for the transcript
layer), `openAt` produces the authentication path, and `verifyOpen` re-hashes
the leaf up the path and compares roots. Its `binding` field is a theorem ONLY
relative to collision-resistance of the compression function: an adversary
opening one root to two values at a position exhibits a hash collision along
the paths — the standard Merkle binding reduction. What this residual owes:
(i) the Merkle `commit`/`openAt`/`verifyOpen` as derived objects over the
chosen sponge; (ii) the reduction "equivocation ⇒ collision" as a real
theorem, making `binding` conditional on a NAMED CR hypothesis carried as
structure (exactly as this file carries `binding`), never an axiom; (iii) the
succinctness accounting (root and path sizes — the reason the identity scheme,
sound as it is, is not the deployed one). Until it lands, the honest label:
the commitment LAYER is proved and inhabited (identity scheme, binding a
theorem); the seams are closed GIVEN any `BindingCommitment`; the deployed
Merkle/sponge instance is priced, not assumed. The `t`-column erasure lift
(partial openings to full words inside the mutual-agreement set) is
`[ACC-extract-bind]`(b), owed in `Selvage/AccExtract.lean`'s ledger, riding
`Selvage/CorrelatedAgreement.lean` — not re-owed here.

## Ledger

* `OpeningScheme` / `PositionBinding` / `BindingCommitment` — the layer's
  vocabulary; binding a Prop FIELD (honest floor), never an axiom.
* `idealCommitment` — the inhabitation witness, binding PROVED; `Inhabited`
  instance registered (the `Oracle.empty` pattern).
* `word_binding`, `opened_eq_committed`, `commit_injective` — derived binding
  at the word level; the deep step of every seam.
* `BindingCommitment.card_le` / `isEmpty_of_card_lt` — the type's scope: no
  inhabitant at a root smaller than the word space
  (`no_bindingCommitment_compressing`).
* `committed_extract_bind` / `committed_fold_bind` — `[ACC-extract-bind]`
  (a) + (c) closed at the all-positions resolution; (b) stays upstream.
* `decider_open_sound` / `decider_open_complete` — `[DEC-open]` closed at the
  same resolution, both directions.
* Keystones — satisfiable (`ideal_commit_opens`, `ideal_open_computes`),
  teeth (`ideal_binding_fires`, `ideal_binding_computes`, `seam_teeth`),
  premise inhabitation (`committed_extract_bind_fires`, `decider_open_fires`,
  `ideal_decider_accepts`), load-bearing (`equivocal_not_binding`,
  `equivocal_no_binding_extension`, `equivocal_breaks_extract_bind`).
* Residual — `[COMMIT-CR]` (prose above).
* `#print axioms`: `idealCommitment` — NO axioms; `word_binding` —
  `Quot.sound`; the seam theorems (`committed_extract_bind`,
  `committed_fold_bind`, `decider_open_sound`) — `propext`, `Quot.sound`;
  keystones add `Classical.choice` (via `decide`'s `Decidable` instances). -/
