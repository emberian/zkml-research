//! # `trace_rotated` — the live rotated (R=24) trace generator.
//!
//! From the 188-column v1 face plus a per-turn rotated witness, this module builds the current
//! 709-column ungraduated trace: two 239-column state blocks and the 43-column caveat region.
//! Chip graduation appends 7 lanes at each of 134 sites, producing the deployed 1647-column base
//! shape. The common rotated PI vector is [`ROT_PI_COUNT`] entries ([`V1_PI_COUNT`] v1 + four
//! rotated commit pins) — 39 = 35 + 4 since the 2026-08-07 seven-slot compaction, 46 = 42 + 4
//! before it; wide members append the DFA and faithful-commitment carriers from that base.
//!
//! ⚠ **PROSE RESIDUE, MEASURED 2026-08-07 AND NOT SWEPT.** Roughly thirty comments and docblocks
//! below this line still say `46` / `PI 46` / `PIs 46..=52` / `47..50` where they mean
//! `ROT_PI_COUNT` / `ROT_PI_COUNT + k`, and `effect_vm_descriptors.rs` carries about twenty-five
//! more (`"rotated 46-PI"`). Every LOAD-BEARING literal in the rotated family was resolved against
//! the emitted registry and converted to a derivation; these are narration only, and they are
//! listed here rather than half-corrected because a partly-updated set of numbers reads worse than
//! a uniformly stale one. `docs/PI-DISPOSITION.md` §6 is the authority; when in doubt read
//! `V1_PI_COUNT` / `ROT_PI_COUNT` below, never a number in a sentence.
//!
//! ## Law #1 — the shapes come from Lean
//!
//! Every quantity this module computes matches a Lean definition (the Rust interprets, never
//! invents):
//!
//! * the 178-limb absorption order is `EffectVmEmitRotationV3.preLimbsAt`; the caller's
//!   `RotatedBlockWitness::pre_limbs` is already in that order, and `NUM_PRE_LIMBS` plus every
//!   faithful-8 group coordinate are generated from the verified Lean `rotated178` layout;
//! * the welds (`r0↔balance_lo`, `r1↔nonce`, `r2↔balance_hi`, `r3..r10↔fields`,
//!   `cap_root↔cap_root`) are `EffectVmEmitRotationV3.weldsAt` — overridden here per-row from
//!   THAT row's own v1 state block so the weld gates `colEq` hold on EVERY row;
//! * the chained commitment is `EffectVmEmitRotationR.wireCommitR` (4-wide head, 3-wide chip
//!   groups while ≥ 3 pre-iroot limbs remain, the iroot absorbed ALONE last, arity ∈ {2,4}) —
//!   byte-identical to the staged probe builder (`descriptor_ir2::rotation_probe_trace_r`),
//!   the producer's `wire_commit`, and `effect_vm_descriptors::rotation_layout_for`;
//! * the caveat manifest + chained `caveatCommit` are
//!   `EffectVmEmitRotationCaveat.{RotCaveatManifest, caveatCommit}` (1 count + 4 × 7-felt
//!   entries `[type_tag, domain_tag, key, p0..p3]`, then a 10-site chain).
//!
//! The four appended PI carriers are PI 42..45: row-0 BEFORE `state_commit`, last-row AFTER
//! `state_commit`, last-row AFTER `committed_height`, and last-row `caveat_commit`.
//!
//! The deployed per-turn proof uses the wide rotated registry path. Layout refactors here must remain
//! byte-preserving unless a separately acknowledged federation re-key deliberately regenerates VKs.
