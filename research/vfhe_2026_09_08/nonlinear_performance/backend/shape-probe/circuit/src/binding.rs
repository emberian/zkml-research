//! Canonical action-binding commitment for STARK proofs.
//!
//! This module defines the single authoritative function for computing the
//! binding commitment that ties a STARK proof to the (action, resource) pair
//! it authorizes. All three layers (prover, wire verifier, turn verifier) MUST
//! use this function to ensure they agree on what the proof is bound to.
//!
//! The binding domain is `(action, resource)` — the semantically meaningful
//! parts of an authorization request. Anti-replay fields (nonce, timestamp)
//! are NOT part of the binding because they change between requests for the
//! same authorization and the proof cannot be bound to values that don't exist
//! at proving time.
//!
//! # Security
//!
//! The binding commitment uses 8 BabyBear field elements (~248 bits of preimage),
//! providing a birthday collision bound of ~2^124 — matching the system's own
//! 128-bit FRI soundness and clearing the 120-bit floor.
//!
//! Width matters here because the action binding is **collision-exposed**, not
//! merely second-preimage-protected. The attacker controls BOTH preimages: it
//! picks a benign `(action_A, resource_A)` (for which an issuer willingly grants
//! a token) and a malicious `(action_B, resource_B)`, and searches for a birthday
//! collision `binding(A) == binding(B)`. A token legitimately issued for A is then
//! presentable wherever a verifier authorizes B (the verifier recomputes
//! `compute_action_binding(B)` and the committed binding matches) — a privilege
//! escalation. At a 4-felt width the search costs only ~2^62, HALF the FRI
//! soundness and below the floor; at 8 felts it costs ~2^124.
//!
//! The same reasoning applies to `WideHash` wherever an attacker controls the
//! hashed preimage (`revealed_facts_commitment`, `composition_commitment`,
//! presentation tags) — all are widened to 8 felts. A use where one side is fixed
//! by a prior commitment the adversary cannot choose would be second-preimage-only
//! (~2^248, fine at any width), but the binding/commitment surface here is not
//! that case, so it carries the full collision-resistant width.
