//! `dregg-circuit::dsl::deco_payment` — the FELT-DOMAIN Stripe/DECO payment identity.
//!
//! The DECO carrier's anti-vacuity keystone (`docs/deos/DECO-CARRIER-PLAN.md` §1,
//! Step 1). The deployed `stripeMint`/`decoMint` row publishes a felt-domain
//! `payment_hash` PI, and the recursion DECO leaf
//! (`circuit-prove::deco_leaf_adapter`) recomputes it IN-AIR from its PI-pinned
//! fact columns — so the two meet in ONE felt domain. This is the direct twin of
//! [`crate::dsl::note_spending::note_spend_mint_hash_felt`] (the bridge carrier).
//!
//! ## ⚑ THE ANTI-VACUITY LAW — felt-domain, NEVER byte-domain BLAKE3
//!
//! The anchor MUST be [`deco_payment_hash_felt`] — a Poseidon2 `hash_fact` chain
//! over the PaymentFacts felts, recomputable in-AIR. It must NEVER be the
//! executor's byte-domain BLAKE3 `payment_nullifier`
//! (`bridge/src/stripe_mirror.rs::payment_nullifier`), which "a circuit could not
//! recompute" — the exact mistake `BridgeBackingAttack`/`DecoBackingAttack` catch.
//! The BLAKE3 nullifier stays the executor's consume-once double-mint key
//! (`note_nullifiers`); the felt `payment_hash` is the light-client-witnessable
//! binding.
//!
//! ## The trust factoring (Option B, per the plan)
//!
//! The in-AIR leaf verifies only the Poseidon2 commitment binding
//! `PaymentFacts → payment_hash` (DecoRelation gates 3/4/5, `Deco.lean`). The
//! ed25519 server-key signature (gate 1), the HMAC-SHA256 transcript MAC (gate 2),
//! and the raw TLS/JSON parse stay OFF-AIR, executor-verified, carried as the named
//! §8 carriers — exactly what `Deco.lean::deco_binds_payment` already proves.
