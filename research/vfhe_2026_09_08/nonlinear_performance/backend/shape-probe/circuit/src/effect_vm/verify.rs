/// DIFFERENT places: `to_trace_cols` copies the carried `state_commitment` verbatim into
/// row 0's `state_before.state_commit` column, while `PI[OLD_COMMIT_BASE..]` is recomputed
/// FRESH from the fields (`generate_effect_vm_trace_ext`'s `compute_commitment_8`). A stale
/// carried value therefore produces a trace whose committed-state column disagrees with the

/// `caveatCommit` to the published caveat-commit PI — `pi_index 45` on every R=24 cohort
/// descriptor). Returns `Ok` iff every required tag appears; otherwise the first missing tag.
///
/// The difference from [`verify_slot_caveat_coverage`] is the LEG: that function scans the off-AIR
/// full-v1 PI manifest (the `>= pi::BASE_COUNT` leg, NOT what a pure light client binds); this one
/// runs against the manifest a pure light client DOES bind — the rotated carrier whose
/// `caveatCommit` is folded into the ~124-bit wide commit. A forger cannot publish a manifest here
/// that differs from the committed one without moving the bound caveat commit (the Lean
/// `EffectVmEmitRotationCaveat.caveatCommit_binds`), so omission on this leg is impossible (the Lean
/// `Dregg2.Deos.CapacityCarrier.carrier_omission_impossible`). The caller reconstructs the
/// `RotatedCaveatManifest` and verifies its `caveatCommit` equals the bound PI before calling this.
///
/// STAGED beside the deployed empty-manifest default; NOT VK-affecting (the carrier binding is
/// already deployed). See `docs/deos/VK-EPOCH-CONSTRAINT-BINDING-DESIGN.md` §6.
