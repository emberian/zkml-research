//! Generalized effect-action binding **schemas + layout constants** (`EffectActionSchema`, `HASH_LIMBS`,
//! `AMOUNT_LIMBS`) — NOT an AIR (the name is historical; 2026-07-16 sweep).
//!
//! ⚠ The line this header used to carry — "This file authors NO constraints in any of the three
//! dialects" — was FALSE. `effect_action_to_descriptor2` (below) BUILDS the constraint list in Rust:
//! it pushes `VmConstraint::PiBinding` and `WindowGateSpec` values directly. Those two families are
//! byte-pinned to their Lean author (`Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.EffectActionBindingEmit.effectActionDesc`,
//! via `EffectActionBindingRefine`), so they do not currently DISAGREE with Lean — but they are
//! Rust-authored, which is the standing law's subject, and the pin is what keeps them honest, not
//! the construction. See the ⚑ on `effect_action_to_descriptor2` for the one place the Rust
//! construction is genuinely WEAKER than its Lean author.
//!
//! Sibling AIR to the (now DELETED) `bridge_action_witness`. That bridge AIR established the pattern:
//! a 32-byte field becomes 8 BabyBear limbs (4 bytes each), a u64 amount
//! becomes 4 BabyBear limbs of 16 bits each, and each limb is pinned to a
//! trace-row-0 column via a boundary constraint. Transition constraints force
//! every row to equal row 0, so a malicious prover cannot put one set of
//! parameters in row 0 and another in row 1 to slip past the boundary check.
//!
//! `bridge_action_witness` shipped a *fixed* schema (nullifier + recipient +
//! destination_federation + amount). This module generalizes the same shape to
//! an arbitrary list of named 32-byte fields and named u64 amounts, so each
//! `Effect` variant can have its parameters bound at full fidelity without
//! authoring a new AIR per variant.
//!
//! # Layout
//!
//! Given a schema with `N` 32-byte fields and `M` u64 amounts, the column /
//! PI layout is:
//!
//! ```text
//! col / PI 0..8           field[0] limbs        (8 × 4-byte BabyBear)
//! col / PI 8..16          field[1] limbs
//! ...
//! col / PI 8N             amount[0] limb 0  (bits  0..16)
//! col / PI 8N + 1         amount[0] limb 1  (bits 16..32)
//! col / PI 8N + 2         amount[0] limb 2  (bits 32..48)
//! col / PI 8N + 3         amount[0] limb 3  (bits 48..64)
//! col / PI 8N + 4         amount[1] limb 0
//! ...
//! ```
//!
//! Total trace width = 8N + 4M. Total PI count = 8N + 4M. Each PI slot
//! corresponds 1:1 with a row-0 boundary constraint on the same column.
//!
//! # ⚑ WHY 16-BIT LIMBS AND NOT 32 (flag day 2026-08-06)
//!
//! A 32-bit limb HAS NO BABYBEAR FELT: `p = 2013265921 < 2^32`, so
//! `BabyBear::new(lo)` reduces and `lo = 0` collides with `lo = p`. A
//! "full-fidelity binding" that collides on the amount is not full
//! fidelity. The same arithmetic showed up as a hard refusal on the
//! descriptor side: the Lean author's Burn borrow gate carried the
//! coefficient `2^32 = 4294967296` and `parse_vm_descriptor2` REFUSED the
//! emitted descriptor — *"constant at byte 3619 does not fit a BabyBear
//! felt"* — so `dregg-effect-burn-v1` could not be read by its own parser.
//!
//! 16 bits is the felt-sized width: a u64 is EXACTLY four limbs (no
//! truncation, no wasted capacity), the borrow weight `2^16 = 65536` is a
//! felt, and every chain gate body is bounded by `2^18` — far inside `p` —
//! so the prover's mod-`p` reading and the ℤ reading of Lean's forcing
//! lemmas COINCIDE. The authority is
//! `Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.EffectActionBindingEmit` (`LIMB_BITS = 16`,
//! `AMOUNT_LIMBS = 4`, `burn_chain_exact_of_modEq`); this file follows it.
//!
//! # Why a generalized AIR rather than one-per-effect?
//!
//! The bridge-action AIR is its own module for historical / dispatch reasons
//! (the bridge wire format references the proof shape by name). For
//! subsequent effects we factor: one AIR with a per-effect *schema*, and
//! per-effect *witness builders* in this same module. Each effect's
//! `prove_X_binding` / `verify_X_binding` pair uses the same AIR with a
//! different schema. The AIR's `air_name` mixes in the effect kind so the
//! Fiat-Shamir transcript domain-separates different effect kinds (a proof
//! generated for effect A cannot replay as effect B even with the same
//! parameter bytes).
//!
//! # What this AIR does and does NOT do
//!
//! Does: full-fidelity binding of typed parameters into the proof's PI.
//! Tampering on any byte of any 32-byte field, or any bit of any u64 amount,
//! produces a different limb encoding which mismatches the boundary
//! constraint, which fails STARK verification.
//!
//! Does NOT: replay protection, ledger-state consistency, cross-effect
//! ordering, or anything specific to an effect's *semantics*. Those live one
//! layer up (executor / Effect-VM / per-effect side proofs).
