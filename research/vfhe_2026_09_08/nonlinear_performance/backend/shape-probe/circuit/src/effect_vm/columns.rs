//! - `sel` — one boolean column per effect type (NUM_EFFECTS = 29).
//! - `state` — 14 columns describing cell state at row enter/exit.
//! - `param` — 8 effect-typed parameter columns.
//! - `aux_off` — NUM_AUX auxiliary witness columns.

/// The aux block decomposes as:
///   `aux[8..10]` = state commitment intermediates;
///   `aux[11]` = cumulative custom-effect count (sum-check, Stage 1);
///   `aux[12..20]` = old_reserved bit-decomposition for sealing honesty (Stage 2),
///   plus mode_flag bit at `aux[20]`;
///   `aux[21..22]` = retired ResizeQueue sign/mag slots (always zero since the
///   queue family dissolved; compacted in the descriptor-regeneration lane);
///   `aux[23..28]` = sovereign-witness key-commit + sequence;
///   `aux[28..36]` = federation-id + owner-cell-id binding (γ.2 #131/#132);
///   `aux[36..96]` = W9-RANGECHECK 30+30 bit decomposition of new_balance_lo/hi,

///   bit-decomposed, so the STARK rejects it IN-circuit.
///
