//! The WHOLE-IMAGE FOLD CHIP: the in-circuit realization of the `hpin` obligation —
//! an AIR that COMPUTES the depth-`d` binary-Merkle fold of an ENTIRE declared
//! whole-boundary view and PINS it to a published-root public input.
//!
//! ## What this closes (the single named in-circuit obligation of `fc679a5f`)
//!
//! The deployed cross-cell read (`circuit/tests/effect_vm_umem_real_turn.rs`,
//! `MapOp::Read` against a published peer root) realizes only the per-cell SUBSET
//! view: each declared address opens to the peer's committed value under the
//! published binary-Merkle root (`opensToMerkle_functional`). On its own it does
//! NOT forbid a committed peer heap holding the declared cells AND EXTRA cells the
//! boundary never declared.
//!
//! ## ⚠ THE CORRESPONDENT THIS BANNER NAMED WAS THE WRONG OBJECT (corrected 2026-07-28)
//!
//! This section used to name `metatheory/Dregg2/Exec/UniversalBridge.lean`'s
//! `crossCellRead_whole_image` / `cross_cell_read_no_extra_cell` /
//! `cross_cell_read_whole_image_teeth` as the Lean soundness this chip realizes, and
//! called their hypothesis `hpin : mapRoot hash d boundaryHeap = publishedRoot` "the
//! in-circuit obligation this module realizes". It also stated that "the deployed map
//! root is … `heap_root.rs::CanonicalHeapTree::root`, modelled byte-identically by
//! `MapMerkleRoot.mapRoot`". **Three things were wrong, each fatal on its own:**
//!
//!   1. `mapRoot` folds ARITY-2 leaves `hash[addr, value]`. The deployed tree has
//!      folded ARITY-3 INDEXED-Merkle leaves `hash[addr, value, next_addr]` since
//!      2026-07-12 (`919b2b0b8d`; [`crate::heap_root::HEAP_LEAF_ARITY`] `= 3`,
//!      [`HeapLeaf::preimage`]). `mapRoot`'s own doc-comment retracts the
//!      byte-identity claim, and `MapReconcileImtRepoint.imtRoot_ne_mapRoot` proves an
//!      arity-3 IMT root is NEVER an arity-2 `mapRoot` under CR.
//!   2. This chip does not compute `CanonicalHeapTree::root` either. [`whole_boundary_fold`]
//!      computes [`CanonicalHeapTree8::root8`] — EIGHT-felt digests
//!      ([`HeapLeaf::digest8`] leaves, [`crate::heap_root::heap_node8`] nodes), and the
//!      published root is an eight-lane PI GROUP ([`WIF_PI_PUBLISHED_ROOT`]). `mapRoot`
//!      is a single field element: there was no `hpin` OF THAT SHAPE at this chip's
//!      public input at all.
//!   3. `mapRoot` folds the DENSE `2^d` leaf vector. The deployed tree prepends one MIN
//!      sentinel and ZERO-pads a sparse prefix.
//!
//! ★ **The Lean object this chip's fold DOES realize is
//! `Dregg2.Circuit.WholeImageFoldRealization.wholeBoundaryFold8`** (over `padImtRoot8`:
//! relink, arity-3 eight-lane leaves, MIN sentinel, zero padding, `node8` fold), and the
//! no-extra-cells cone at that object is `crossCellRead_wholeImage8`,
//! `cross_cell_read_no_extra_cell8_chip` and `whole_boundary_fold8_teeth` in the same
//! module — with the binding `padImtRoot8_binds_or_ghost_or_collides` (no hash floor; two
//! named residuals: the padding ghost and a collision at the ONE pair the extractor
//! returns). `padImtRoot8_ne_arity2Root8` is the separation, at this chip's own width.
//!
//! The `UniversalBridge` four remain TRUE about `mapRoot` and are the arity-2 MODEL leg.
//! They are NOT about this chip and must not be cited as its soundness.
//!
//! The correspondence is pinned by `circuit/tests/whole_image_fold_lean_correspondent.rs`,
//! which re-derives this chip's fold from the Lean denotation's shape and refuses if the
//! two drift apart again.
//!
//! ## The construction (binary fold via a sorted-INSERT chain from the EMPTY root)
//!
//! The deployed map root is the depth-16 `node8` Merkle fold of the sorted, MIN-sentinel-headed,
//! relinked heap's ARITY-3 eight-felt leaf digests
//! ([`CanonicalHeapTree8::root8`] = [`crate::heap_root::compute_canonical_heap_root_8`], the value
//! `CellState::heap_root: Faithful8` carries and the rotated commitment absorbs at
//! `HEAP_ROOT_GROUP`). Rather than introduce a
//! fresh fold gadget, this chip computes that exact fold with the DEPLOYED,
//! already-sound `MapKind::Insert` reconciliation: a sorted insert of a fresh key
//! authenticates the post-insert root against the pre-insert root in-circuit (the
//! membership path of the new leaf rides the chip/fact bus).
//!
//! Chaining a fresh insert per declared boundary cell, starting from the EMPTY root,
//! reconstructs `mapRoot` over EXACTLY the declared cells:
//!
//! ```text
//!   empty_root --insert(c_0)--> r_1 --insert(c_1)--> r_2 --...--> r_n = published_root
//! ```
//!
//! The chip forces the chain to be load-bearing:
//!
//!   * `PiBinding{First, root}`         — the FIRST row's pre-root = the empty root PI
//!                                        (the fold starts from nothing — no smuggled cell);
//!   * one `MapOp::Insert` per real row  — each link is a genuine sorted insert of the
//!                                        row's `(key, value)` (a fresh address; duplicate
//!                                        addresses have no insert witness and REFUSE);
//!   * a `WindowGate` chain link         — `new_root[i] == root[i+1]` on every transition
//!                                        (the post-root of one link is the pre-root of the
//!                                        next — the prover cannot break the chain);
//!   * a padding-preserve `Gate`         — `(1 - guard)·(new_root − root) == 0` (a non-insert
//!                                        padding row preserves the root, so the chain carries
//!                                        the final fold to the last trace row);
//!   * `PiBinding{Last, root}`           — the LAST row's pre-root = the published-root PI.
//!
//! Together: the published root is FORCED to equal the fold of exactly the
//! committed `(key, value)` boundary cells. A peer heap with one extra/altered cell
//! folds to a DIFFERENT root, so its genuine published commitment can no longer be
//! pinned — the no-extra-cells tooth bites in-circuit (the anti-ghost
//! `WholeImageFoldRealization.whole_boundary_fold8_teeth` proves at the object this chip
//! folds, up to the padding ghost and the named extractor collision).
//!
//! ## ⚠ THE "ROTATION-INTEGRATION POINT" WAS NEVER A VERIFIER-SIDE BINDING (deleted 2026-08-06)
//!
//! This section used to announce a REALIZED cross-table wiring: a `*_bound` descriptor pair
//! (`whole_image_fold_bound_descriptor` / `whole_image_fold_bound_mem_descriptor`) that drove one
//! `UMemOp::Read` / `MemOp::Read` per fold link against a boundary table, and it concluded that
//! "the chip thus folds EXACTLY the read peer's declared field-plane boundary … no longer a
//! free-floating list". **The boundary table was the free-floating list.**
//!
//! `verify_vm_descriptor2` builds its public values as `pvs = [public_inputs]` and then
//! `resize(airs.len(), vec![])` — **only the MAIN instance receives public values.** The umem /
//! flat-mem boundary instance is committed by the prover and handed an EMPTY public-value vector,
//! so the verifier has no handle on its contents whatsoever. The wrappers' public inputs were
//! `[empty_root8, published_root8]` — byte-identical to the UNBOUND chip's. An adversary supplies
//! the boundary table too, so it simply supplies one that agrees with its own fold rows.
//!
//! The teeth measured accordingly: all three `*_bound*_refuses` tests refused inside
//! `prove_whole_image_fold_bound*`, never inside the verifier, and the only verify-side refusal
//! they exercised (`..._smuggled_start_root_refuses`) was [`assert_empty_root_pin`] — which is the
//! UNBOUND wrapper's check, present identically below. A prover handed self-inconsistent inputs
//! failing is not a soundness property; it is the honest prover declining to lie to itself.
//!
//! So the pair added nothing a verifier could observe, while being cited as though it did
//! (`docs/WELD-STATE.md` named `whole_image_fold_bound_mem_forged_minit_refuses` as a BUILT tooth
//! for the flat-`minit` hole). Per `CLAUDE.md` — *never keep a no-op, because the next reader
//! trusts it* — both descriptors, both witness builders, both prove/verify pairs and their eight
//! tests are DELETED rather than re-labelled.
//!
//! **What would make it real:** the boundary table is only meaningful when it is SHARED with a
//! proof whose own public inputs anchor it — i.e. the fold riding the real turn descriptor's
//! batch, where the boundary is the turn's declared boundary and the turn's PIs pin the pre/post
//! state roots. That is a fusion with no consumer today, and inventing one to keep this alive
//! would be building the constituency rather than finding it. The complementary
//! `declared ⊆ committed` direction still rides the deployed per-cell `MapOp::Read` against the
//! published root. The fold arithmetic — the `hpin` content, and the ONLY part with a Lean
//! correspondent — is the self-contained chip below, whose teeth ARE verifier-visible: both root
//! PI groups are pinned, and `assert_empty_root_pin` forces the fold to start from nothing.

// ===========================================================================
// DELETED 2026-08-06 — the two BOUND variants (232 lines):
//   `whole_image_fold_bound_descriptor` / `boundary_witness_for_fold` /
//   `prove_whole_image_fold_bound` / `verify_whole_image_fold_bound`, and their flat-memory
//   twins `whole_image_fold_bound_mem_descriptor` / `boundary_mem_witness_for_fold` /
//   `prove_whole_image_fold_bound_mem` / `verify_whole_image_fold_bound_mem`.
//
// Why: see the module banner, §"THE ROTATION-INTEGRATION POINT WAS NEVER A VERIFIER-SIDE
// BINDING". `verify_vm_descriptor2` gives public values to the MAIN instance only, so the
// boundary table those descriptors bound against was prover-supplied and verifier-invisible;
// their public inputs were byte-identical to the unbound chip's, and every boundary tooth
// refused at PROVE time against a boundary the same prover had just built from the same list.
//
// The unbound chip below is unaffected: its `PiBinding{First/Last}` root groups and
// `assert_empty_root_pin` are verifier-visible, and it is the only half with a Lean
// correspondent (`Dregg2.Circuit.WholeImageFoldRealization.wholeBoundaryFold8`).
