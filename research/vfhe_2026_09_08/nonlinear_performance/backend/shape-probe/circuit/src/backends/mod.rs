//! Proof backends for dregg circuits.
//!
//! The production backend is **Plonky3** (BabyBear + FRI STARK, below). The
//! former Mina/Kimchi/Pickles backend family was REMOVED: its pickles wrap
//! never verified the Kimchi proof in-circuit (the recursive step was
//! vacuous scaffolding), so it provided no soundness the Plonky3 path does
//! not — see `.docs-history-noclaude/PROOF-ECONOMICS.md` §4.
//!
//! # Trait Hierarchy
//!
//! The backend capability surface is organized as a set of focused traits:
//!
//! ```text
//! ProofBackend (membership + fold — original, backward-compatible)
//!     │
//!     ├── DerivationBackend (rule application proofs)
//!     ├── PredicateBackend (arithmetic, relational, temporal, compound)
//!     ├── AccumulatorBackend (non-membership / non-revocation)
//!     ├── PresentationBackend (full composed authorization statement)
//!     └── CrossStateBackend (cross-state derivation composition)
//!
//! FullProofBackend: ProofBackend + DerivationBackend + PredicateBackend
//!                 + AccumulatorBackend + PresentationBackend
//!                 + CrossStateBackend
//! ```
//!
//! Backends implement whichever traits they support. The `FullProofBackend`
//! supertrait is a convenience bound for code that requires the complete surface.

/// Plonky3 backend: production-grade STARK using BabyBear + FRI.
///
/// Always compiled. When the `plonky3` feature is enabled, membership proofs
/// use the native Plonky3 prover with inline Poseidon2 constraints for full
/// algebraic soundness. Without the feature, falls back to the custom STARK.
/// Implements the full `FullProofBackend` trait hierarchy.
