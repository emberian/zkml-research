//! **`descriptor_by_name`** — the descriptor-world analog of
//! [`crate::dsl::descriptors::circuit_for_air_name`] (Foundation 1).
//!
//! The StarkProof→descriptor-prover migration replaces the runtime AIR-name → `DslCircuit`
//! dispatch (`circuit_for_air_name`, a match over v1 `CircuitDescriptor` circuits) with a
//! dispatch into the IR-v2 descriptor world: each predicate kind's proof is re-expressed as an
//! [`EffectVmDescriptor2`] proven through [`crate::descriptor_ir2::prove_vm_descriptor2`] and
//! checked by [`crate::descriptor_ir2::verify_vm_descriptor2`]. This module is the production
//! dispatch table for that world.
//!
//! ## The #1 migration danger this closes
//!
//! A wrong or MISSING dispatch arm is a SILENT verify failure: the consumer that cannot find a
//! descriptor for a predicate must NEVER fall through to "accept". So [`descriptor_by_name`]
//! returns [`Option::None`] on a miss — never a stand-in descriptor, never a silent accept — and
//! every mapped name is covered by the round-trip test below (name → descriptor → decode →
//! well-formedness; and, for the membership family, real prove → verify).
//!
//! ## The predicate-kind → descriptor map (ground-truthed from the migration scout)
//!
//! | [`PredicateKind`] | descriptor(s) ([`descriptor_names_for_kind`])                          |
//! |-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
//! | `Dfa`             | `dfa-routing-toggle-2state::poseidon2-v1` (DfaRouting)                  |
//! | `Temporal`        | `dregg-temporal-predicate-gte::dsl-v1` (TemporalPredicate)             |
//! | `MerkleMembership`| `merkle-membership-depth2-4ary::poseidon2-v1` + the depth-GENERAL builder |
//! | `NonMembership`   | `dregg-membership-adjacency-wide::node8-v1` + `quantified-absence-…`    |
//! | `BlindedSet`      | `dregg-accumulator-nonrev-emit-v2`                                      |
//! | `BridgePredicate` | `dregg-predicate-arith-ge::threshold-v1` (+ the le/gt/lt/neq/inrange siblings) |
//! | `Custom`          | `dregg-effectvm-custom-v1` (customVmDescriptor2)                        |
//! | `PedersenEquality`| NONE — off-STARK Schnorr, no descriptor (returns `&[]` / `None`)        |
//!
//! ## Where the descriptors come from (byte-pinned)
//!
//! Each predicate descriptor is emitted from Lean (`metatheory/Dregg2/Circuit/Emit/*Emit.lean`)
//! and byte-pinned there by an `emitVmJson2` `#guard`. The consts below `include_str!` the
//! checked-in `circuit/descriptors/by-name/*.json` files and decode them via
//! [`crate::descriptor_ir2::parse_vm_descriptor2`].
//!
//! What ties those files to the Lean is `EmitByName.lean` + `scripts/emit-descriptors.sh`: every
//! by-name descriptor is now RE-DERIVED from its Lean author on each drift-check run
//! (`scripts/check-descriptor-drift.sh`), and `scripts/emit_descriptors.py`'s coverage check
//! recurses into `by-name/`, so a file no emitter reproduces is a routing-gap failure. This closed
//! a real hole: the by-name goldens used to reach disk by an UNGATED hand transcription of the Lean
//! `#guard` string, and `predicate-arith.json` had drifted through it to a 5-wide re-authoring with
//! both Poseidon2 weld legs missing — a deployed, demonstrated forgery. The route now forbids that
//! divergence; the falsifier is `circuit/tests/predicate_arith_fact_weld_canary.rs`.
//!
//! The depth-general Merkle membership is built by [`membership_descriptor_of_depth`]
//! (Foundation 2), not parsed.

    // `circuit/src/presentation.rs:90`, `wasm/src/lib.rs:408` — are never handed one of these
    // strings anywhere in the repo. `turn/src/executor/` contains exactly ONE head verifier,
    // `mina_head_verifier.rs`. So the row above is a claim about DISPATCH, and the sentence a reader
    // should take away is *"a node CAN prove this"*, never *"a node checks this"*.
    //
    // ⚑ **THE JUDGEMENT, PER CHAIN — three GAPS and one PREMATURE, not four by-design.** The
    // missing consumer has the same shape in every case, and `mina_head_verifier.rs` is the worked
    // example: a `WitnessedPredicateVerifier` under a fixed `Custom { vk_hash }`, registered in
    // `turn/src/executor/membership_verifier.rs::registry_with_real_verifiers` beside the Mina row,

    //   DECISIONS already come from the Lean archive (`verified_gate::decide` →
    //   `dregg_lean_ffi::verified_eth_lc_verify`). Its only production caller is the standalone CLI
    //   `eth-lightclient/src/bin/verify_holding.rs`; `node/`, `turn/` and `persist/` do not depend
    //   on that crate at all. So a verified ETH decision terminates in a Rust `Bool` on the
    //   operator's own machine and produces NO dregg state transition — verbatim the wound
    //   `mina_head_verifier.rs`'s header was written about, one chain over. Missing consumer:
    //   `turn/src/executor/eth_head_verifier.rs`.
    // * **`tm` — GAP, and colder.** `cosmos-lightclient::verify_cosmos_header` (→
    //   `verified_tm_lc_verify` / `verified_tm_skip_verify`) has NO production call site in the
    //   repo — only that crate's own tests and `dregg-interchain-gov`'s. Both legs, native and
    //   STARK, are unconsumed. Missing consumer: `turn/src/executor/tm_head_verifier.rs`.
    // * **`solana` — THE SHARPEST GAP, because here the native leg IS live and the proved one is
    //   not.** `bridge/src/solana_relayer.rs:836` and `:929` call
    //   `solana_trustless::verify_lock_proof_consensus{_anchored}` on the real finalized-RPC mint
    //   path, so Solana consensus verification already gates value movement — in hand-written Rust,
    //   outside any AIR. Meanwhile the node's own live Solana surface
    //   (`node/src/poa_holding_api.rs`) imports only `validate_rpc_snapshot`, the RPC-beta trust
    //   tier, NOT the consensus path; and `poa-solana-gate::verify_consensus_source`, the one
    //   function that can return a `ConsensusVerified` holding, has no non-test caller. Missing
    //   consumer: `turn/src/executor/solana_head_verifier.rs`, with
    //   [`SOLANA_STAKE_TABLE_FOLD_JSON`] as its SUB-PROOF — exactly the relationship
    //   `dregg-pasta-fq-chainlink::v1` has to the Mina head rung: verify the fold, then pin the
    //   light client's `PI_TOTAL_STK` slots 19..22 against the denominator it published.
    // * **`midnight` — NOT a gap; PREMATURE, and say so rather than implying a peer.** There is no
    //   Midnight light client in this tree. `bridge/src/midnight.rs` verifies an ed25519
    //   `FederationAttestation` — a 2/3 multisig over dregg's own federation — which is not a header
    //   verification, and `midnight_inclusion.rs`'s mirror tree is an explicit BLAKE3 PLACEHOLDER
