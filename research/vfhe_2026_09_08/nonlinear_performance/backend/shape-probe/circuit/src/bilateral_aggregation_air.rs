//! Stage 7-γ.2 Phase 2 — joint bilateral aggregation AIR.
//!
//! See `STAGE-7-GAMMA-2-PHASE-2-SKETCH.md` for the full design.
//!
//! This module collapses Phase 1's "N per-cell STARK proofs + Rust cross-cell
//! match loop" into a single outer AIR whose public input is the reduced
//! bundle-level summary. The outer trace has one row per inner per-cell proof
//! (padded to a power of two). Each row carries that proof's decoupled 49-felt
//! bilateral-schedule block (`Sched.*`) lifted into trace columns plus 3
//! accumulators (width **52** in the compacted v3 layout). The AIR's constraints
//! then enforce, in one algebraic pass:
//!
//!   CG-2  turn-identity agreement (per-row, IN-CIRCUIT in v3)
//!         The FIRST row's identity slots [TURN_HASH, EFFECTS_HASH_GLOBAL,
//!         ACTOR_NONCE, PREVIOUS_RECEIPT_HASH] are pinned to the outer PI by
//!         `pi_binding`, and 13 identity-carry `window_gate`s force
//!         `next[c] == local[c]` on every transition — so EVERY row's identity
//!         slots equal the published turn identity. (v2 bound only the first +
//!         last rows, leaving the middle rows' identity columns in-AIR
//!         unconstrained — the gap `BilateralAggregationCompact.gapTrace`
//!         exhibits; v3 closes it, proven `compact_identity_every_row`.)
//!
//!   CG-3  schedule replay — RETIRED in v3.
//!         v2 spent 35 gates on `sched[13+k] == expected[49+k]` where BOTH
//!         blocks were prover-filled from the same row, so the block was a
//!         tautological self-check that pinned nothing (any trace satisfied it
//!         by copying). Those 35 gates + their 35 dead expected columns are
//!         DELETED. The schedule block's counts/roots are bound to the canonical
//!         Turn OFF-AIR (`verify_aggregated_bundle` step 5, `schedule.counts_for`
//!         / `roots_for`) — that is the real closure, not the deleted self-check.
//!
//!   CG-4  IS_AGENT_CELL accounting
//!         running cumulative sum of IS_AGENT_CELL across rows. Boundary:
//!         last row's cumulative == 1. (When N_CELLS is the active prefix,
//!         padding rows carry IS_AGENT_CELL = 0 and contribute nothing.)
//!
//!   CG-5  cross-side existence
//!         expressed as a per-row "schedule-covered" indicator: a row's
//!         expected counts being nonzero must be matched by *another* row
//!         claiming the peer side. Today this is enforced *outside* the AIR
//!         by the prover's schedule-construction logic — the AIR's job is
//!         to confirm what the prover claims, not to discover unbundled
//!         peers. (CG-5 in Rust-shape is part of the prover-side wiring
//!         and the verifier's outer-PI cross-check, not an AIR constraint
//!         group of its own. The Phase-2 sketch flags it as the most
//!         delicate group; we land the matrix variant in a follow-up.)
//!
//!   BILATERAL_CONSISTENT
//!         outer PI slot, must equal 1; constrained to 1 at the last row.
//!
//! ## Inner-proof recursive verification (CG-1)
//!
//! Phase 2's headline win is *also* collapsing each inner STARK verify into
//! the outer AIR. With the now-paved `plonky3_recursion_impl` substrate, the
//! aggregation prover composes:
//!
//!   1. Phase-1 verify of each inner Effect VM proof (classical Rust call).
//!   2. The outer aggregation AIR proof over their PIs.
//!   3. (Optional) a recursive-layer proof of (2), produced via
//!      `prove_recursive_layer_for_air` — this is the constant-size
//!      verification artifact Phase 2 promises.
//!
//! Step (3) means the outer verifier never re-runs (1): the recursive layer
//! attests that the outer AIR accepted its inputs, and the outer AIR's CG-2
//! through CG-5 plus the row PIs *being the inner PIs* binds those inputs
//! to the per-cell proofs the prover ran in (1). A consumer downstream needs
//! only (3) + the outer PI to know the bundle is bilaterally consistent.
//!
//! ## Trace layout (DEPLOYED — the decoupled v3 `agg::*` layout)
//!
//! `width = agg::WIDTH` = **52** columns. Per row:
//!
//! ```text
//!  [0  .. 13)   schedule turn-identity  — 4 turn-hash + 4 effects-hash + nonce
//!                                          + 4 previous-receipt (the 13 slots the
//!                                          identity-carry window gates pin)
//!  [13 .. 20)   schedule counts         — 7 bilateral count fields
//!  [20 .. 48)   schedule roots          — 7 × 4-felt root fields
//!  [48]         is_agent_cell           — bool: this row is the agent cell
//!  [49]         is_agent_cumulative     — running sum of IS_AGENT_CELL
//!  [50]         consistent_indicator    — bool 1 = this row's checks pass
//!  [51]         n_cells_active          — running active-row counter
//! ```
//!
//! (v2 also carried a 35-felt `expected_counts`/`expected_roots` block at
//! `[49, 84)` and 35 gates checking `schedule == expected`; both sides were
//! prover-filled, so the block was a tautology — DELETED in v3, which is
//! −40% committed columns.)
//!
//! Boundary constraints:
//! - `is_agent_cumulative[last] == 1`
//! - `outer_pi[BILATERAL_CONSISTENT] == 1`
//!
//! ## Outer PI layout
//!
//! ```text
//!   0..4    OUTER_TURN_HASH
//!   4..8    OUTER_EFFECTS_HASH_GLOBAL
//!   8       OUTER_ACTOR_NONCE
//!   9..13   OUTER_PREVIOUS_RECEIPT_HASH
//!  13..21   OUTER_AGENT_CELL_ID   (8-felt cell-id decomposition)
//!  21       OUTER_N_CELLS         (number of active rows in the trace)
//!  22       OUTER_BILATERAL_CONSISTENT  (must == 1 for accept)
//! ```
//!
//! Fixed width: 23 felts, independent of N. This is the headline win for
//! verifier complexity vs. Phase 1's `N × 74` per-bundle PI.

// ===========================================================================
// CG-5 IN-CIRCUIT — cross-side existence as an algebraic balance AIR
// ===========================================================================
//
// The original CG-5 ("every outgoing edge has its matching incoming peer in
// the bundle") was a Rust precondition (`verify_bilateral_chain`'s HashSet
// existence loop). This AIR makes it an *algebraic* constraint.
//
// ## The argument
//
// Walk every directed bilateral edge the canonical Turn schedule predicts
// (transfers + grants; introduces are handled as their pairwise role edges).
// For each edge `e = (from, to)` with canonical, direction-independent id
// `edge_id` we conceptually emit two half-edges:
//
//   * an OUTGOING half claimed by `from` (sign = +1)
//   * an INCOMING half claimed by `to`   (sign = -1)
//
// A half-edge is *materialised as a trace row only if its self-cell is a
// participant in the bundle*. The AIR maintains a running balance
//
//   balance[i] = balance[i-1] + sign[i] * edge_fp[i]
//
// where `edge_fp = Poseidon2(edge_id)` is a collision-resistant fingerprint
// of the canonical (direction-independent) edge id. The boundary constraint
// pins `balance[last] == 0`.
//
// ### Why sum-to-zero ⟺ no missing peer (soundness)
//
// If every edge that touches the bundle has BOTH endpoints in the bundle,
// then each `edge_fp` appears once with +1 and once with -1: every term
// cancels and the balance is 0. If some edge has exactly one endpoint in the
// bundle (the "missing peer" attack the brief flags), that edge contributes a
// single, uncancelled `± edge_fp` term. For the balance to still be 0, that
// surviving term must be cancelled by another edge's term — i.e. two distinct
// canonical edge ids must collide under Poseidon2 (`edge_fp_a == edge_fp_b`,
// `id_a != id_b`), or the prover must fabricate an `edge_id`/`sign` that
// disagrees with the canonical schedule.
//
// The first — collision of two distinct canonical edge ids under `edge_fp` — is
// NOT ~124-bit hard here: `edge_fp` is a SINGLE BabyBear image (one 31-bit felt),
// so its collision resistance is only ~31-bit (birthday ~2^15.5). The in-circuit
// balance == 0 boundary therefore is NOT, on its own, a cryptographic missing-peer
// detector. The REAL closure is OFF-AIR (the "second" clause below): the verifier
// re-derives the *exact* multiset of canonical half-edges (id, sign, self-in-bundle)
// from the Turn and requires the proof-bound trace rows to equal it. So a malicious
// prover cannot drop a half-edge, flip a sign, or invent an edge id — an
// uncancelled term cannot be papered over by a felt-collision because the trace
// multiset is pinned to the canonical schedule. (To make the in-circuit balance
// itself a cryptographic detector, `edge_fp` would need widening to 4 felts; the
// off-AIR multiset re-derivation is what closes it today.)
//
// This is a genuine in-circuit replacement for the Rust existence loop: the
// uncancelled-term detection is performed by the STARK over the committed
// trace (FRI + boundary opening) BOUND to the off-AIR canonical multiset, not by
// a Rust `HashSet` alone.
//
// ## Trace layout (`CSE_WIDTH` columns)
//
// ```text
//   [0..4)  edge_id           — canonical direction-independent 4-felt id
//   [4]     edge_fp           — Poseidon2(edge_id) fingerprint
//   [5]     sign              — +1 (outgoing) or p-1 (== -1, incoming)
//   [6]     present           — 1 for a real half-edge row, 0 for padding
//   [7]     balance           — running balance prefix sum (this row inclusive)

// PROOF-OF-PROOFS / TREE FOLD — BundleTreeFoldAir
// ===========================================================================
//
// The original aggregator produced a single, flat outer proof over one Turn's
// per-cell proofs. This AIR adds the recursive layer the brief asks for: an
// outer attestation over a *tree of child AggregatedBundles*. Each child
// bundle is reduced to a fixed digest (a Poseidon2 hash of its outer PI), and
// the fold AIR commits a hash chain over those digests:
//
//   acc[0]    = digest[0]
//   acc[i+1]  = Poseidon2( acc[i], digest[i+1] )   (2-to-1 compress)
//
// The final accumulator is the outer attestation's public input. Verifying
// the fold proof is O(1) in the number of children (the headline recursion
// win). The verifier separately re-checks each child bundle classically and
// recomputes the expected accumulator, so the fold proof binds the exact set
// of children it claims.
//
// ## Trace layout (`FOLD_WIDTH` columns)
//
// ```text
//   [0]  acc_in    — chain accumulator before absorbing this child
//   [1]  digest    — this child's bundle digest
//   [2]  acc_out   — Poseidon2(acc_in, digest)  (this row's chain output)
// ```
